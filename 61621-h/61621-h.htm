<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p><i>While I was composing in Latin
the Original of this small Production,
I was sensible of its defects, and, in
the Preface to it, made my apology for them.
But, after the Performance appeared in print,
they struck me much more forcibly; and when
I came to examine the French translation of it,
which I had been desired to revise, I judged
them intolerable.</i></p>

<p><i>Besides a number of new observations necessarily
to be added, there were faults to be
remedied, in the method, and some articles
which, being no more than the first outline, insufficient
to convey what I had to say, required
a fuller extent to be given them.</i></p>

<p><i>So many corrections rendered the Work
almost a new one, and made it considerably
longer. The difficulty of carrying on this
undertaking in a living language, and all the
disagreeable circumstances that must cleave to
it, did not escape me. Nothing could have determined
me to engage in it, but the prospect
of the utility to mankind of such an undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
well executed, which is, however,
what I dare not boast of. It is only my intention
that I can warrant. The crimes of
one’s fellow creatures afford but a melancholic
object to concern one’s self with: the consideration
of them can only afflict and mortify
one: a sentiment ballanced by no pleasure but
that of hoping to contribute to the diminution
of their frequency, and to alleviate the sufferings
which are the consequences of them.</i></p>

<p><i>But what has given me much more trouble,
in this Work, than if I had written it in
Latin, is the embarrassment of expressing
images, of which the terms and descriptions
are declared indecent by use. A dispensation,
however, from a due attention to these scruples
would have been very disagreeable to my
own disposition, with which I could never
have reconciled any labor at the expence of
what I pride myself on, a due regard for the
laws of decency. Yet to this duty it is that
are owing the great difficulties that stopped
me at every step. I dare aver, then, that I
have neglected no precaution for giving to
this Work all the modesty in the expressions
that the subject would admit. There are,
indeed, certain objectionable images inseparable
from this matter; but how could I avoid
them? Was it fit for me, on such important
objects, to keep silence? Doubtless not. The
sacred Authors, the Fathers of the Church,
who almost all wrote in living languages;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
the Theological Writers, have not thought
themselves obliged to pass over in silence the
crimes of obscenity, because they could not be
pointed out without naming them, without
words, in short. I judged myself authorised
to follow their example, and I dare say, with
St. <span class="smcap">Augustin</span>, “If what I have written
scandalizes any vitious persons, let them
rather blame their own turpitude than the
words which I have been obliged to make
use of, for explaining my thoughts on the act
of generation in mankind. I hope that the
truly modest and virtuous reader will easily
forgive the expressions which I have been
forced to employ.” I will add to what this
great Divine says, that I hope to merit the
grateful acknowledgment and approbation of
the moral and the sensible, who know the
general proneness of the world to wicked
practices, and who will approve, if not my
success, at least the intention of my undertaking.</i></p>

<p><i>I have not in this, no more than in my first
edition, touched upon the moral part, and
that for <span class="smcap">Horace</span>’s reason</i>,</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>I have proposed to myself to write on the diseases
produced by self-pollution, and not on the
crime of self-pollution, considered as a crime;
is it not proof enough of its being one, the demonstrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
that it is an act of self-murther?
Whoever knows mankind, will not be difficultly
persuaded, that it is easier to give them an
aversion against a vice, by the fear of a present
evil, than by reasons founded on principles,
of which there is not care enough taken to inculcate
to them all the truth and solidity. I
have applied to myself what an author, whose
name will pass to the remotest posterity, as an
honor to the age in which he lived, makes a
Clergyman say: “We are put upon undertaking
to prove the utility of prayer, to a
man who does not believe there is a God;
and the necessity of fasting, to one who has,
all his life, denied the immortality of the
soul: such an attempt is rather difficult,
and the laugh is not on our side<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.”
<span class="smcap">Marphurius</span> doubted of every thing till
<span class="smcap">Sganarelle</span> broke his bones; and then
<span class="smcap">Marphurius</span> believed.</i></p>

<p><i>These <span class="antiqua">Zoïluses</span> of society and literature,
who themselves do nothing, and blame every
thing that is done, will have the assurance to
say, that this Work is fitter to spread than to
stop this vice, and that it will make it known
to such as would otherwise have remained in
ignorance of it. I shall make them no answer;
they deserve none; it is debasing one’s self to
do them that honor: but there are those of
weak though virtuous minds, upon whom these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
objections might make an impression: to these I
owe a general reflexion, it is this, that, in
that point of light, my Book is liable to no
worse exception than what might be made to
all books of morality: they must be all prohibited,
if pointing out the dangers of a vice
was the way to multiply it. The sacred
writings, those of the Fathers, those of the
Casuists, ought all to be forbidden before mine
is so. Besides, what young person is likely to
think of reading a Treatise of Physic on a
matter of which he does not so much as know
the name? It is to be wished, indeed, that
this Book were become familiar to all persons
to whom the education of youth is committed;
it might be of service to them to set an early
watch; and detect, in time, any practice of this
detestable habit; it would enable them to take
the precautions they should judge necessary for
preventing the consequences.</i></p>

<p><i>Those who do not understand Latin, will,
perhaps, find fault with there being too many
verses in that language; my answer is, that
there are none which are not connected with
the subject, since there is not one that was
not recalled to my mind by the chain of ideas.
I have, however, so disposed them, that they
may be skipped without any injury to the
thread of the discourse. Those who understand
them, will rather be pleased with me for
them: a traveller is, in the midst of a dreary
barren heath, rejoiced at the sight of a spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
of verdure. In short, if it is a fault, it is not,
I hope, more than a venial one, and on so
disgustful a subject, some relaxation from it
may be forgiven the author. If there are no
quotations from the Poets in our own language,
which would have been more natural,
that is no fault of mine; I knew of none to be
quoted.</i></p>

<p><i>This Work, however, has nothing in common
with the English one upon this subject,
under the title of <span class="smcap">Onania</span>; and except about
two pages and a half, which I have extracted
from it, that rhapsody has been of no use to
me. Those who shall read both performances
will, I hope, be sensible of the total difference
there is between them. Those who shall only
read this one of mine, might, without this advertence,
be deceived by the affinity of the titles<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
and be led to imagine some resemblance
between the two books; happily there is none.</i></p>

<p><i>This new edition, is, by the additions, augmented
almost a third, and I hope they will
meet with a favorable reception from all
competent judges. There will probably be two
objections made to me: the one, that I have
added a great number of observations and
authorities, which are little more than repetitions
of those that were already in the first
edition; the other, that in some places I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
too much departed from my leading or principal
title, and that I have considered the danger
from the pleasures of love under a general
point of view.</i></p>

<p><i>To the first objection, I answer, that in a
matter of this nature, where there is less
hope of convincing by reasons than of terrifying
by examples, one can hardly accumulate
too many.</i></p>

<p><i>To the second, I say, first, that when two
matters are intimately connected, the more
you endeavour to detach one, the worse you
treat of it; secondly, that I was glad to render
this Work of as much general utility as
possible.</i></p>

<p><i>I have been told, that it is the reading of
that part, that caused horror to an illustrious
Professor: I do not believe it. But if it
should be true, I would desire him to peruse
this Preface, which I must suppose had in
such case escaped him.</i></p>

<p><i>In writing upon Inoculation, I had proposed
to myself to propagate the method that I
judged the properest to stop the ravages of that
murderous distemper; and I have had the satisfaction
of doing, at least, some good: in
composing this Work, I have been encouraged
by the hope of checking the progress of a corruption
more rife, more destructive perhaps
than the small-pox itself, and so much the
more to be dreaded, for that its operations
being carried on in the shades of secrecy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
mystery, it undermines without noise, without
even those, who are its victims, suspecting its
malignity. It was of the greatest importance
to make its dangers known. May that Power,
to whom every thing is subordinate, vouchsafe
to my views that blessing without which our
best endeavours can be of no avail!</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>

from <span class="smcap">God</span> alone.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Man is every instant losing something
of himself, and if he was not
continually repairing that loss, he
would soon necessarily fall into a weakness
productive of death. This reparation is effected
by aliments. But these aliments must
undergo in the body different preparations,
which are comprehended under the name of
nutrition. But when that nutrition is either
not performed, or deficiently so, all these
aliments become useless, and do not hinder
the falling into all the evils which are the
consequence of atrophy or inanition. Of all
the causes that may hinder nutrition, there
is not perhaps a more common one than
over-abundant evacuations. Such is the fabric
of our machine, and in general of all
human machines, that for aliments to acquire
the degree of preparation necessary to
repair the body, there must remain in it a
certain quantity of humors well elaborated,
and, if I may use the expression, naturalised
to it. If this condition of them is defective,
the digestion and coction of the aliments remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
imperfect, and so much the more imperfect,
as the humor that is needed requires
the most elaboration, and is of the most importance.</p>

<p>A healthy robust nurse, from whom the
taking some pounds of blood in twenty-four
hours, would probably kill, would furnish
to her child the same quantity of milk,
for four or five days running, without any
sensible inconvenience to her, because milk
is, of all the humors, that which requires
the least elaboration, being, a secretion almost
distinct from the humors of the body;
whereas blood is an essential of life. There
is another humor, the seminal liquid, which
has so great an influence over the forces of
the body, and over the accomplishment of
the digestions which repair them, that the
Physicians of all ages have unanimously believed,
that the loss of one ounce of this humor
weakened more than the loss of forty
ounces of blood.</p>

<p>Some idea may be gathered of its importance,
from observing the effects which it
operates on its first beginning to form itself:
the voice, the aspect of the physiognomy,
even the lineaments themselves of the face
undergo an alteration: the beard appears,
the whole body often takes another air, from
the muscles acquiring a largeness and firmness
that constitute a sensible difference between
the body of an adult and, that of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
young man who has not passed the season of
pubescence. All these developements are
stopped or hindered by the loss of the organ
which serves for the separation of that liquid
which produces them; very just observations
having proved, that the amputation of the
testicles, even in the age of virility, has occasioned
the shedding of the beard, and the
return of an infantine voice<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. After that,
can there be any doubt of the power of its
action over the whole body? Does not it
sensibly give reason for apprehending the
multitude of evils which must arise from the
waste or profusion of so pretious an humor?
Its natural destination determines the only
allowable means of its evacuation. Disorders
will sometimes occasion its efflux. It
may be involuntarily lost through the effect
of lascivious dreams. The author of <i>Genesis</i>
has left us the history of the crime of <span class="smcap">Onan</span>,
doubtless in order to transmit with it that of
his punishment; and we learn from <span class="smcap">Galen</span>,
that <span class="smcap">Diogenes</span> was guilty of the like
pollution.</p>

<p>If the dangerous consequences of the over-abundant
loss of this humor depended only
on the quantity, or were the same, quantity
for quantity, with the other humors, it would
not, in a physical light, be of much importance,
in which of the above ways the evacuation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
was made. But the manner or form
here is as essential a point, as the substance
of the thing itself, if I may be indulged this
expression, my subject authorising such licence
of language. Too considerable a quantity
of the seminal humor, lost in the natural
way, brings on very grievous disorders, but
which are much worse when the same quantity
has been wasted out of the course of
nature. Those disorders, which such as exhaust
themselves in the natural commerce of
the sexes, bring upon themselves, are dreadful;
but those are much more so which are
produced by self-pollution. It is these last
that are properly the objects of this work;
but the intimate connexion which they have
with the first, hinders the separation of them
in the description. It is then the description
common to both, that shall form the <i>first
Article</i>. This shall be followed by the explanation
of the Causes, a <i>second Article</i>, in
which I shall state those that render the consequences
from self-pollution the most dangerous:
The Means of Cure, and Remarks
on some Diseases that have an affinity to that
cause, shall conclude the Work. I will add
throughout, the Observations of the best Authors
to those which I have myself made.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The <span class="smcap">Symptoms</span>.</i></span></h2>

<h3>SECTION I.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Description drawn from the Works of Physicians.</i></span></h3>

<p>Hippocrates, the most antient
and the most exact of all the observers
of Nature, has already described
the evils produced by excessive venery,
under the name of the Dorsal Consumption,
in Latin, <i>Tabes dorsalis</i><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.—“This
disease (says he) proceeds from the
spinal marrow. It attacks young married
folks, or those addicted to lustful excesses.
They have no fever, and though they eat
as much as usual, they turn lean, and
waste away. They imagine they feel
something, as it were like ants, descending
from the head, and creeping down
the back-bone. In their evacuations by
stool or urine, they lose abundance of the
seminal liquid much thinner than it naturally
is. They are unfit for generation,
and are often busied in the act of it, in
their dreams. Walking, especially in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
bad road, soon puts them out of breath,
weakens them, brings on heavinesses of
head; they have a kind of tingling in
their ears; at length an acute fever (<i>lypiria</i>)
terminates their days.”</p>

<p>Some Physicians have attributed to the
same cause, a disease which <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>
describes elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, and which has some
affinity to the first: this last they call “the
secondary <i>tabes dorsalis</i>.” But the continuance
under it of the bodily strength,
which he particularly specifies, appears to
me a convincing proof, that this last disease
does not acknowledge the same cause as the
first. It seems rather a rheumatic affection.
For example, <span class="smcap">Celsus</span>, in his excellent book
on the preservation of health, says, “the
pleasures of coition are always pernicious
to weak constitutions, and the frequent
use of them enfeebles the strong.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>”</p>

<p>Nothing can be conceived more dreadful
than the description which <span class="smcap">Aretæus</span> has
left us of the evils produced by an over-abundant
evacuation of that humor. “The
young (says he) contract the looks and the
infirmities of old age; they become pale,
effeminate, torpid, inactive, stupid, and
even drivellers; their bodies are bent, their
legs refuse their office; they have a general
distaste, and grow unfit for all the offices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of life; many fall into a palsy<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.”
In another place he sets down the pleasures
of venery among the six causes that produce
the palsy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Galen</span> has seen the same cause produce
diseases of the brain and nerves, and destroy
the vital force<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>He says in another place, that a man who
was not thoroughly recovered of a violent
disorder, died on the same night that he
acquitted himself of the nuptial function
with his wife.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pliny</span> the Naturalist tells us, that <i>Cornelius
Gallus</i>, a Prætor advanced in years,
and <i>Titus Ætherius</i>, died in the act itself of
coition.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>“The stomach (says <span class="smcap">Ætius</span>) is weakened;
the transgressor falls into a paleness,
leanness, dryness; his eyes are hollowed
in his head<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.”</p>

<p>These attestations of the most authoritative
among the antients, are confirmed by
a crowd among the moderns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sanctorius</span>, who has, with the greatest
accuracy, examined all the causes that
act upon the human body, has observed, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
this one weakened the stomach, ruined the
digestions, hindered the insensible perspiration,
the interruptions or disorders of which
are attended with such bad consequences,
produced a heat in the liver and kidneys,
disposed for the stone, diminished the natural
heat, and commonly drew after it a weakness
of the eyes<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lommius</span>, in his excellent Commentaries
on the passage I have quoted from <i>Celsus</i>,
seconds the testimonies of his author,
with his own observations. “Too frequent
emissions (says he) of the seminal liquid
relax, drain, weaken, enervate, and produce
a multitude of evils; apoplexies, lethargies,
epilepsies, a dozingness, maladies
of the eyes, loss of sight, tremors, palsies,
convulsions, and of all the kinds of gout,
the most painful one<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.”</p>

<p>There is no reading without horror, the
description left us by <span class="smcap">Tulpius</span>, that celebrated
Burgomaster and Physician of Amsterdam.
“Not only (says he) the spinal
marrow wastes away, but both body and
mind languish alike; the individual perishes
miserably. <i>Samuel Vespretius</i> was
attacked with the defluxion of an excessively
acrid humor, which first seized the
back part of his head and the nape of his
neck: thence it passed to the spine, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
loins, the haunches, and the joints of the
thigh, occasioning to the unhappy patient
such acute pains and tortures, that he became
totally disfigured, and fell into a
slow fever, that kept consuming him, but
not so fast as he could have wished, his
condition being so intolerable, that he
frequently invoked death before it came
to his deliverance from his sufferings<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.”</p>

<p>Nothing (says a celebrated Physician of
Louvain) so much weakens the vital faculties,
and abridges life<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blancard</span> had seen simple gonorrhœas,
consumptions, and dropsies all acknowledging
this cause<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muys</span> had seen a man as yet unbroken
with age, attacked with a spontaneous gangrene
in the foot, which he attributed to
venereal excesses<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Memoirs of curious Naturalists</i> mention
the circumstance of a loss of sight, the
observation of which deserves a recital at
large. “It is (says the author) unconceivable,
what a sympathy the repositories of
the seminal humor have with the whole
body, but especially with the eyes. <i>Salmuth</i>
saw a learned hypochondriac run
raving mad, and another man, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
brain was so dried up, that it might be
heard shaking as it were loose within the
skull; both owing to their having abandoned
themselves to excesses of venery.
I myself saw a man of fifty-nine years of
age, who, three weeks after marriage
with a young woman, fell into sudden
blindness, and died at the end of four
months<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.”</p>

<p>The over-dissipation of the animal spirits
weakens the stomach, palls the appetite,
and nutrition no longer proceeding in its
due course or degree, all the parts languish,
and an epilepsy is sometimes the consequence<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</p>

<p>We cannot, it is true, say that the animal
spirits and the seminal humor are the
same thing, but observation has taught us,
as will be subsequently seen, that these two
fluids have a great affinity.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> has seen the most dreadful
accidents follow a waste of the seed.</p>

<p>“After a long course of nocturnal pollutions
(says he) not only the strength diminishes,
the body is emaciated, the face
turns pale, but moreover the memory
fails, a continual sensation of cold seizes
all the limbs, the sight dims, the voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
grows hoarse<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; the whole body insensibly
decays; the sleep, disturbed by uneasy
dreams, brings with it no refreshment,
and one feels pains like those which
follow a severe beating<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.”</p>

<p>In his consultation for a young man, who,
among other disorders, had brought upon
himself a weakness in the eyes, by self-pollution:
“I have (says he) seen many
examples of persons, who, even in the age
of full growth, that is to say, when the
body is come to the plenary enjoyment of
its vigor, had drawn upon themselves not
only a redness and extreme pains in the
eyes, but also so great a weakness of the
sight, as to be no longer able to read or
write. I have even seen two instances of
a <i>gutta serena</i> produced by this cause<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.”</p>

<p>It will probably not be unpleasing here,
the specifying the history of the disease
which gave rise to the consultation precedently
quoted.</p>

<p>“A young man having, from the age of
fifteen, abandoned himself to the practice
of self-pollution, had, by the frequency
of that act till the age of twenty-three,
brought upon himself such a disorder of
the head, and especially such a weakness
in the eyes, that they particularly were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
seized with violent convulsions at the time
of the seminal emission. If he attempted
to read, he felt a dizziness somewhat like
that of drunkenness. The <i>pupilla</i> was
extraordinarily dilated. He suffered extreme
pains in the eye; his eyelids felt
heavy, and glewed up every night; his
eyes were always suffused with tears, and
in the two corners of them, both very
painful, there was constantly gathering a
whitish matter. Though he ate his meals
chearfully, he was reduced to extreme
leanness, and as soon as he had eaten, he
would fall into a kind of drunken stupor.”</p>

<p>The same author has preserved to us another
observation on a case, of which he
himself had been an ocular witness, and
which deserves a place here. “A young
man about eighteen years of age, having
had an over-frequent intercourse with a
servant-maid, fell all on a sudden into a
great faintness, with a general tremor in
all his limbs; his face flushed, and a very
weak pulse. He was recovered out of
this slate, in about an hour’s time, but
he remained under a general languor.
The same fit frequently returned, with
an intolerable anguish, and in eight days
time brought on a contraction and a tumor
of the right arm, with a pain at his
elbow, which redoubled at every fit. This
disorder proceeded for some time augmenting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
notwithstanding all the remedies that
were used. However, M. Hoffman cured
him at length<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.”</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> paints these disorders
with that energy and exactness which characterise
all his descriptions.</p>

<p>“An excessive profusion (says he) of the
seminal humor produces lassitude, feebleness,
immobility, convulsions, emaciation,
desiccation, pains in the membranes of
the brain; it obtunds the senses, and especially
the sight; it brings on the <i>tabes
dorsalis</i>, a general torpor, and various other
diseases which have an affinity to
those<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.”</p>

<p>It would not be right here to omit the
observations which this great man communicated
to his hearers, on his explaining this
aphorism to them, and which turn upon
the different means of evacuation.</p>

<p>“I have (says he) seen a patient, whose
illness began by a languor and weakness
all over his body, especially towards the
loins; it was accompanied with such a
motion of the tendons, such periodical
convulsions, and wasting away, as were
enough to destroy the whole body: he
also felt a pain in the membranes of the
brain, a pain which the patients call a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
dry burning heat, with which the noble
parts are, in this case, continually affected.</p>

<p>“I have also seen a young man seized
with a <i>tabes dorsalis</i>. He had been an
extremely pretty figure, and though he
had been often admonished against the
over-indulgence of venery, he would still
abandon himself to it, and became so deformed
before his death, that all that
muscular roundness, which appears over
the spinal apophyses of the loins, was entirely
sunk and flattened. In this case the
brain seems to be consumed, and, in fact,
the patients become stupid. The body
loses all its suppleness to such a degree,
that I never saw such immobility produced
by any other cause. The eyes also
contract a notable dimness, or difficulty
of seeing<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.”</p>

<p>M. de <span class="smcap">Senac</span>, in his first edition of his
Essays, set forth the dangers of self-pollution,
and denounced to the victims of this
infamy all the infirmities of the most languishing
old age, in the flower of their
youth. In the following editions may be
seen his reasons for the suppression of this
passage, and of some others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ludwig</span>, in his description of the
evils attending over-abundant evacuations,
does not forget the seminal one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“The young (says he) of either sex, who
abandon themselves to lasciviousness, ruin
their health, by a dissipation of that
strength which by nature was designed to
bring their body to its greatest point of
vigor. In short, they fall into a consumption<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.”</p>

<p>M. de <span class="smcap">Gorter</span> enters into particulars of
the most dreadful accidents deriving from
this cause; but as it would be of too great
a length to copy him, I refer to his work
those who understand the language in which
he wrote<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Van Swieten</span>, after a recital of the
above-quoted description of the <i>tabes dorsalis</i>
by <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>, adds:</p>

<p>“I have seen all these symptoms, besides
many more, befall those who had abandoned
themselves to the infamy of self-pollutions.
During three years, I employed,
in vain, all the aids of the medical
art, for a young man, who, by this
vile habit, had brought on himself erratic,
surprizing, and general pains, with
a sensation sometimes of heat, sometimes
of a very irksome cold all over his body,
but especially towards the loins. These
pains having, afterwards, been a little diminished,
he felt so great a cold in his
thighs and legs, although those parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
seemed to the touch to have preserved
their natural warmth, that he was continually
warming himself at the fire, even
during the greatest heats of the summer.
But what more particularly astonished
me, was a continual motion of rotation
in the testicles, and the patient complained
grievously of a like motion which he
felt in his loins<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.”</p>

<p>This narration does not inform us whether
this wretched object terminated his life
at the end of the three years, or, what is
worse, yet continued to languish on, for
some time longer; for there could hardly be
a third issue.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Kloekoff</span>, in a very good work on
those distempers of the mind which depend
on the body, confirms, by his observations,
what has been here advanced on this subject.</p>

<p>“Too great a dissipation of the seminal
humor weakens the springs of action in
all the solids; thence arise weakness, laziness,
listlessness, hectics, the <i>tabes dorsalis</i>,
a torpor, and depravation of the
senses, stupidity, madness, epilepsies, convulsions<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.”</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> had already remarked,
that young people who abandoned themselves
to that shameful practice of self-pollution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
“lost, little by little, the faculties of
the understanding, especially the memory,
and became intirely unapt for study<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.”</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span> describes all these evils: but
I shall only transcribe from his work, what
relates to the detriment occasioned to the
intellectual faculties.</p>

<p>“All the evils which arise from excesses
committed with women, are also effected
in early life, by that abominable practice
in school-boys, a practice which I cannot
describe in terms odious enough, <i>pollutio
sui</i>, which, actuated more by vitiousness
than by sense and reason, and ignorant of
the mischievous consequences, they repeat,
&amp;c. &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> ... So intimately are
the mind and body blended together, that
there cannot be any disease of the one
which will not influence the other; but in
none is the <i>mind</i> more deeply affected than
in this. To add to his infelicity, a melancholy
gloom attends the patient, and
silence and solitude are anxiously sought
after.—The chearful haunts of men no
longer delight him; he is absent in company,
and will have no part of the conversation.
He is not happy even in his
friend: a sense of his misfortune, and perhaps
the aggravating circumstance of having
brought it upon himself, for ever hang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
on his mind. The company of the female
sex he loves indeed, but the apprehensions
that he may be cut off from nuptial felicity,
interrupts the fruition of their pleasing
converse. Thus deeply dejected, he
excludes himself from society, wanders in
retirement, and it is well if he seeks not
to destroy himself at last<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.”</p>

<p>Fresh observations, subsequently introduced,
will confirm the truth of the preceding
dreadful description. That one furnished by
M. <span class="smcap">Storcke</span>, in the valuable work which
he has published on the history and cure of
diseases, is not less terrible: but I refer the
curious to the work itself, which no physician
would wish to be without. The passage
I allude to is in his <i>Medicus annuus</i>, T. ii.
p. 215, &amp;c. But before I terminate this
Section, I shall here conclusively add a passage
in that excellent work, with which M.
<span class="smcap">Gaubius</span> has lately enriched the medical
art. He not only paints the evils, but points
out the causes of them, with that force, that
truth, that sagacity, that exactness, which
can belong to none but so great a master.
It is a most valuable extract; and that the
coloring of it may appear in its true lustre,
I subjoin to the translation the original of
it, in the language of the author’s expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“An immoderate profusion of seed is pernicious,
not only through the waste of
that most useful humor, but also through
the over-frequent repetition of that convulsive
motion which is produced by
the emission. For the highest pitch of
that pleasure is immediately succeeded
by so universal a relaxation of the animal
strength, as cannot be borne often
without a consequential enervity. The
more frequent a draught there is on the
secretory ducts of the body, the greater is
the derivation of the respective humors of
the secretions; so that in the case of the
liquid being repeatedly attracted to the
parts of generation, the rest of the secretions
are depauperated: thence, from excesses
of venery follow, weariness, weakness,
immobility, a tottering gait, pains
of the head, convulsions, a hebetation
of all the senses, and especially of the
sight, blindness, intellectual imbecillity, a
feverish circulation, dryness, leanness, a
phthisis, a <i>tabes dorsalis</i>, an effeminate
habit of body. These evils are liable to
augment and become incurable through
that perpetual pruriency for venery which
the mind does not less than the body at
length contract; and from which it follows,
that obscene imaginations haunt
even the dreams of persons so affected,
and that the parts prone to the libidinous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
turgescence are, on every occasion, impetuously
sollicited, while the quantity of
the repaired seminal fluid, were it never
so small, occasions constantly a troublesome
stimulation, and is ready to start
from its relaxed repositories with any the
least endeavour, or even without any endeavor
at all. Whence it is clear why
an excess of this nature is so capable of
blasting the flower of youth<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<h3>SECTION II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Observations communicated.</i></span></h3>

<p>I shall preserve no other order than that
of the dates of my receiving these observations.</p>

<p>“I have (says my illustrious friend M.
<span class="smcap">Zimmermann</span>,) seen a man of twenty-three
years of age, who became epileptic,
after having weakened himself by frequent
self-pollutions. As often as he had nocturnal
pollutions, he fell into a complete
fit of epilepsy. The same thing happened
to him after any commission of that act,
from which however he would not abstain,
notwithstanding those consequences,
and all the admonitions against it. Having,
however, abstained from it for some
time, I cured him of the nocturnal pollutions,
and had even hopes of removing
his epilepsy, of which the fits were already
gone off. He had recovered his strength,
his stomach, his sleep, and a very good
color, after having looked like a corpse.
But being returned to his acts of self-pollution,
which were always followed by an
attack of the epilepsy, he came at length
to be taken with fits in the street, and he
was found one morning dead in his chamber,
fallen out of his bed, and bathed in
his own blood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>May I be allowed one question, which
occurred to me when I read this observation?
It is this: Can such as blow their brain out
with a pistol, who drown themselves in a river,
or cut their own throats, be accounted more
guilty of self-murther than this man?</p>

<p>My friend adds, without entering into
particulars, that he knows another who is
in the same case: I have since learnt, that
he ended his days in the same manner.</p>

<p>“I knew (says Mr. <span class="smcap">Zimmermann</span>) a
man of great genius, and of almost universal
knowledge, whom frequent pollutions
had reduced to lose all the activity
of his understanding, and whose body was
exactly in the condition of the patient that
consulted Boerhaave<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.”</p>

<p>Of this case I shall hereafter take notice.</p>

<p>I owe the two following facts to M. <span class="smcap">Rast</span>,
junior, an eminent Physician of Lions, with
whom I had the pleasure of passing some
months at Montpelier.</p>

<p>A young man at Montpelier, a student of
physic, perished by his excesses in the practice
of self-pollution. His imagination was so horror-struck,
that he died in a sort of despair,
fancying that he saw hell open, on the side
of him, to receive him.</p>

<p>A child of that town, not above six or
seven years old, taught, I believe, by a servant-maid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
practised it so frequently; that a
hectic fever coming on, soon cut him off.
His fury of passion for this act was so great,
that there was no hindering him to the very
last days of his life. When it was represented
to him that he was hastening his
death, his comfort, he said, was, that he
should the sooner rejoin his father, who was
dead a few months before.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Mieg</span>, a celebrated physician of Basil,
well known in the literary world by some
excellent dissertations, and to whom his
country is obliged for his introduction of
inoculation, of which he continues the practice
with great ability and equal success, has
communicated to me a letter of the Professor
<span class="smcap">Stehelin</span>, a name ever dear to literature,
in which I have found many interesting
and useful observations. Some I reserve
for properer places in the course of this work.
Here I shall but subjoin two instances.</p>

<p>The son of M. ——, aged about fourteen
or fifteen years, died of convulsions,
and a kind of epilepsy, of which the original
cause was self-pollution. In vain was he
attended by the most experienced physicians
of the town.</p>

<p>I also know a young lady of twelve or
thirteen years old, who by this execrable
practice has drawn upon herself a consumption,
together with a timpanous abdomen,
the <i>fluor albus</i>, and an incontinence of urine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Though medicines have alleviated her complaints,
she is still but in a languishing condition,
and I dread fatal consequences.</p>

<h3>SECTION III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Descriptions taken from the book intitled <span class="antiqua">Onania</span>.</i></span></h3>

<p>Since the publication of this work,
I have learnt, from a very respectable
quarter, that an entire faith ought not to
be given to the English collection, and that
this reason, together with certain calumnies,
some obscenities, and the forgery of an imperial
privilege, had made the German translation
be prohibited in the Empire. These
motives would have determined me to suppress
all that I had extracted from that work,
but some considerations have induced me to
preserve it, under the modification of this
præ-advertisement. The first is, that some
of these reasons concern only the German
edition. Another is, that though there may
be some facts invented, as indeed some of
them plainly enough appear to carry with
them a stamp of falsity, it is yet proved, that
the greatest number of them are but too true.
In short, a third consideration which determined
me, is what I find in the above-mentioned
letter of M. <span class="smcap">Stehelin</span>. “I
have (says he) received a letter from M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Hoffman of Maestrich, in which he acquaints
me of his having seen a practiser of
self-pollution, who had already drawn on
himself a <i>tabes dorsalis</i>, which he had, without
success, attempted to cure, and the patient
was afterwards cured by the remedies
of the <i>Onania</i>, of which Dr. <span class="smcap">Beckers</span> of
London is supposeably the author, and so
well cured, that he has recovered his corpulence,
is strong and healthy, and has four
children.”</p>

<p>The English book of <i>Onania</i> is a perfect
chaos, and the most indigested work that
has been produced a long time. It is only
the observations that can bear reading. All
the reflections of the author, whom I could
not believe a physician, are nothing but
theological or moral trivialisms. I shall not
extract from all this work, which is rather
of the longest, any thing but a description
of the most common accidents, of which the
patients complain. The vivacity, the pathetic
expressions of pain and repentance,
which are found in a few of the letters in
that book, I omit in this extract; but the
want of them ought not to weaken the impression
of horror which the reading of the
facts themselves should inspire, as it is on the
facts that the impression depends; and the
readers will rather have to thank me for
sparing him the perusal of a much greater
number of others, without order or diction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
I shall class under six heads those evils of
which the English patients complain, and
begin with the most grievous, those of the
soul.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> All the intellectual faculties are
weakened; the memory fails; the ideas are
confused or clouded; the patients sometimes
even fall into a slight degree of insanity;
they are continually under a kind of inward
restlessness, and feel a constant anguish, with
such pangs of confidence and remorse, as
make them shed tears in bitterness of heart.
They are subject to giddiness; all the senses,
and especially those of seeing and hearing,
grow weaker and weaker; their sleep, if
sleep they can, is disturbed by disagreeable
or frightful dreams.</p>

<p>2. The bodily strength entirely fails; the
growth of those who have not done growing,
and who abandon themselves to this detestable
practice, is considerably checked. Some
can get no sleep at all, others are in a state
of continual dozing. All of them almost
become hypochondriacs, or hysteric, and
are overwhelmed with all the evils that attend
those dreadful disorders; melancholy,
sighs, tears, palpitations; suffocations, fainting
fits. Some have been known to spit
calcarious matter. Coughs, a slow fever,
consumptions, are the punishments which
some find in their own crimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The most acute pains are another subject
of complaint in the patients. One complains
of his head, another of his breast,
the stomach, the intestines, aches of external
rheumatisms; some are affected with an
obtuse sensation of pain in all the parts of
the body, on the slightest impression.</p>

<p>4. There are not only to be seen pimples
on the face, which is one of the commonest
symptoms, but even blotches, or suppurative
pustules, on the face, nose, breast, thighs,
with cruel itchings on those parts. Nay, one
patient complained of fleshy excrescences on
his forehead.</p>

<p>5. The organs of generation come in also
for their share of the sufferings, of which
they are themselves the primary cause.
Many patients become incapable of erection;
in others, the seminal humor comes away
in the moment of the slightest stimulation,
and of the weakest erection; some will even
evacuate it on going to stool. Numbers are
attacked with an habitual gonorrhœa, which
intirely destroys constitutional vigor, and the
matter of it resembles a fetid <i>sanies</i>, or foul
mucosity. Others are tormented with painful
priapisms. Dysuries, stranguries, heat of
urine, a weakening of its spirt, put the patients
to cruel inconveniences and pains.
Some have very painful tumors in the testicles,
in the penis, the bladder, the spermatic
string. In short, either the impossibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of coition, or the depravation of the seminal
humor, renders incapable of procreation
almost all those who have long abandoned
themselves to this crime.</p>

<p>6. The functions of the intestines are
sometimes totally disordered, and some patients
complain of an obstinate costiveness,
others of the piles, or of the running of a
fetid matter from the fundament.</p>

<p>This last observation reminds me of a
young man, who, after every act of self-pollution,
was attacked with a diarrhœa,
which must be an additional cause of a diminution
of strength to him.</p>

<h3>SECTION IV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Author’s Observations.</i></span></h3>

<p>The object of description occurring in
my first observation is dreadful; I was
myself frighted at the first time of my seeing
the unfortunate sufferer, who is the subject
of it. Then it was that I felt, more
than I had ever before done, the necessity of
pointing put to young people, all the horrors
of that precipice down which they voluntarily
cast themselves.</p>

<p>L. D——, a watchmaker, had been
clear of vice, and enjoyed a good state
of health, till the age of seventeen, when
he gave himself up to self-pollution, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
he repeated every day, and often thrice a
day, when the ejaculation was always preceded
and accompanied by a slight fainting
fit, or privation of the senses, and a convulsive
motion of the exterior muscles of the
head, which drew it strongly backward,
while his neck swelled prodigiously. There
had not passed a whole year, before he began
to feel a great weakness after each act:
this warning was not sufficient to draw him
out of the mire. His soul, wholly ingrossed
by the filth of this obscenity, was no longer
capable of any other ideas, and the reiterations
of his crime became every day more
frequent, till he found himself in a condition,
that gave him apprehensions of death. Sensible
of his danger too late, the mischief had
made too great a progress to admit of a cure.
The parts of generation were become so irritable,
and so weak, that there did not need
any fresh act on the part of that wretched
object, to make them let go the seed. The
slightest irritation procured, instantly, an
imperfect erection, which was immediately
followed by an evacuation of that liquid,
and this daily augmented his weakness. That
convulsion, which before he was not used to
experience but just at the time of the consummation
of the act, and which ceased at
the same time, was become habitual, and
often attacked him without any apparent
cause, with such violence too, that during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the time of the fit, which sometimes lasted
fifteen hours, and never less than eight, he
suffered, in the nape of his neck, such violent
pains, that commonly his outcries
sounded like piteous howlings, and it was
impossible for him, while the fit lasted, to
swallow any thing whatever, liquid or solid.
He had contracted a hoarseness of voice, but
I did not observe it more so out of the fit
than in it. He totally lost his strength. Incapable
of every thing, overwhelmed with
misery, he languished, almost without any
assistence, for some months; being the more
to be pitied, for that some remains of memory,
which however it was not long till
that was abolished, only served constantly to
recall to him the causes of his wretchedness,
and to augment to him the horrors of remorse.
I was told his condition. I went
to him, and found him less a living creature
than a cadaverous figure, lying upon straw,
meagre, pale, sallow, sending forth an infectious
smell, and himself almost incapable
of any motion. He bled at the nose a pale
and watery blood, and was continually foaming
at the mouth: attacked too with a diarrhœa,
his excrements came from him
without his perceiving it; the flux of his
seed was continual; his eyes bleared, dim,
or extinguished, had lost their faculty of motion;
his pulse was extremely low, yet quick
and frequent; his breathing very laborious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
his leanness excessive, except just in his feet,
which began to be œdematous. The disorder
of his mind was not less than that of
his body; without ideas, without memory,
without reflections, without anxiety about
his fate, without any other sensation but
that of a pain which returned with every fit,
at least once in three days. A being much
below that of a brute; a sight, of which there
is no conception can reach the horror. It
was not easy to make out that he had ever
belonged to the human species. I procured
for him quickly enough the relief of destroying
those violent convulsive fits, which recalled
him to the power of feeling, only by
the pain they brought with them; but satisfied
with having mitigated his tortures, I
discontinued remedies, which could have no
efficacy on the main of his disorder. He died
at the end of a few weeks, in June, 1757,
œdematous all over his body.</p>

<p>Not all those who give themselves up to
this odious and criminal habit, are, it is true,
so severely punished; but there are none
that do not suffer for it in a less or greater
degree. The frequency of the act, the difference
of constitutions, many adventitious
circumstances, may occasion considerable
differences.</p>

<p>The pernicious consequences that have
fallen under my observation, are, <i>first</i>, a total
disorder of the stomach, which in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
discovers itself by loss of appetite, or by a depravation
or irregularity of its cravings; in
others, by acute pains, especially in the time
of digestion, by habitual nauseas or vomitings,
which resist all remedies, while the cause,
the bad practice, is continued. <i>Secondly</i>, A
weakening of the organs of respiration,
whence frequently result dry husky coughs,
almost always a hoarseness, a failure of voice,
and a shortness of breath, on any little violence
of motion. <i>Thirdly</i>, A total relaxation
of the nervous system.</p>

<p>It does not require a very deep knowledge
of the animal œconomy, to be sensible that
the three prementioned causes are capable of
producing all the diseases of languor, and
experience every day proves their producing
them. The first ill consequences of them,
to such as are guilty of self-pollution, besides
those I have just pointed out, are a considerable
diminution of strength, a less or greater
paleness, sometimes a slight but continual
jaundice, often pimples, which come and disappear
only to make room for fresh ones, and
are constantly reproducing themselves all
over the face, but especially in the forehead,
the temples, and about the nose; a notable
leanness; an astonishing sensibility to the
changes of weather, especially to cold; a
languor in the eyes, a weakening of the
sight, a great impairment of the faculties,
especially of the memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sensible (a patient writes me) that
this wretched practice has diminished the
strength of my intellectual faculties, and
especially of my memory<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.”</p>

<p>I beg leave to insert here the fragments of
some letters, which, combined together, will
form a complete enough description of the
natural disorders produced by self-pollution.
The language in which I wrote (the Latin)
hindered me from making use of them in
the first edition of this work.</p>

<p>“I had the misfortune (says the same
person, who was by this time arrived at the
age of maturity,) like too many other
young people, to suffer myself to be carried
away by the violence of a habit, as
pernicious for the body as for the soul. Age,
indeed, assisted by reason, has, for some
time past, corrected this wretched inclination:
but the ill is done. The disorder
and extraordinary sensibility of the nervous
system, and the accidents resulting therefrom,
are accompanied with a weakness,
a restlessness, a <i>tædium vitæ</i>, a sense of
distress, that all seem to vie with each
other to afflict me. I am consumed by an
almost continued loss of seed. My face is
become as it were cadaverous, so pale, so
livid. The weakness of my body renders
all my motions laborious: that of my legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
is often so great, that they can hardly support
me, and that I dare not go out of my
room. My digestions are so ill performed,
that my aliments come from me, scarcely
more altered, three or four hours after I
have taken them, than when I took them
into my stomach. My breast gets stuffed
with phlegm, the load of which throws
me into a state of anguish, and my expectorations
into a state of faintness. Here
you have a succinct account of my causes
of complaint, which are still aggravated
by the melancholic certainty I have acquired,
that every day will yet be worse
than the precedent ones. In a word, I
cannot conceive that a human creature can
be afflicted with greater evils than I am.
Without the particular grace of Providence,
I could hardly bear up under so
heavy a load.”</p>

<p>It was not without shuddering that I red,
in another patient’s letter, the following terrible
expressions, which reminded me of
some in the (English) treatise of <i>Onania</i>.</p>

<p>“If religion did not restrain me, I should
have already put an end to a life, which is
so much the more miserable for its being
my own fault that it is so.”</p>

<p>There cannot surely be in the world a
more intolerable condition than that of anguish:
a state of pain is nothing in comparison
with it; and when it is superadded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a croud of other evils, it is not at all strange
that the sufferer should wish for death as his
greatest good, and regard life as a real misfortune,
if the name of life can be given to
so deplorable a state.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Vivere cum nequeam, sit mihi posse mori;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Dulce mori miseris, sed mors optata recedit.</i></div>
<div class="attr">M.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following description is less long, and
not quite so terrible as the first one.</p>

<p>“I had the misfortune, in my tenderest
youth, being, to the best of my remembrance,
not above eight or ten years of
age, to contract that pernicious habit of
self-pollution, which very early ruined my
constitution; but especially, for some years
past, I find myself under an extraordinary
oppression: my nerves are extremely
weak, my hands without strength, always
shaking, and in a perpetual sweat. I have
violent pains in my stomach, arms, legs,
sometimes in my loins, and in my breast.
I am often troubled with a cough; my
eyes are always weak and dim; I have a
devouring appetite, and yet I grow very
lean, and never but look extremely ill.”</p>

<p>In the Section on the method of cure,
will be seen the success of the remedies in
this case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nature herself (says a third correspondent)
opened my eyes to the cause of that
languor under which I found myself, and
to the danger of that abyss into which I
was precipitating myself. Pimples or eruptions
on the part which was the instrument
of my crime, and the faintness I felt
in the midst of the act itself, left me no
room to doubt of the cause of my suffering.”</p>

<p>I might add here a great number of cases
of this nature, on which I have been consulted
since the second edition of this work,
but they would be useless repetitions. I shall
only confine myself to two or three of the
most recent.</p>

<p>A man in the flower of his age wrote to
me, but the other day, in the following
terms.</p>

<p>“In my early youth I contracted a most
dreadful habit, which has ruined my
health. I am overwhelmed with stoppages
and giddinesses of my head, which
give me room to apprehend an apoplexy.
I have been bled for them; but those who
advised me, are sensible they were in the
wrong of it. I have a contraction of my
breast, and consequently a difficulty of
breathing. I have frequently pains of the
stomach, and I suffer successively almost
all over my body. In the day-time I am
heavy, inclined to doze, and restless; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the night my sleep is disturbed and agitated,
and does not refresh or repair me.
I have often itchings; I am pale, my eyes
are weak and sore, my complexion is
jaundiced, and I have an offensive breath,
&amp;c.”</p>

<p>Another writes me thus: “I cannot walk
two hundred paces without resting. My
weakness is extreme. I have continual
pains all over my body, but especially in
my shoulders. I preserve my appetite, but
that is rather a misfortune to me, as I
have pains of the stomach the moment I
have eaten, and throw up whatever I have
got down. If I read a page or two, my
eyes water, and are sore. I often sigh involuntarily.
<i>Filo xylino flaccidius veretrum,
omnisque erectionis impotens, semen quidem,
manu sollicitum effluere sinit, nequaquam
vero ejaculat, adeo cæterum imminutum et
retractum, ut oculi de sexu vix judicare
possint.</i>”</p>

<p>The particulars of this case, with the success
of my method of treatment of it, will
appear, in their place, in this work; and I
furnish them with the more reason, for that
he was the most weakened and the most governable
of any patient I have seen.</p>

<p>A third, who had abandoned himself to
this detestable practice, at the age of twelve
years, appeared to have suffered even more
in his intellectual faculties than in his bodily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
health. To the following purpose was the
account of himself: “I feel (says he) my
warmth sensibly diminish. My sensations
are considerably dulled; the fire of my
imagination greatly slackened; the sense
of my existence infinitely less quick; every
thing that passes at present before me appears
to me like a dream; I have difficulty
of conception, and less presence of
mind; in short, I feel I am perishing,
though I preserve my sleep, my appetite,
and am not much altered in my looks.”</p>

<p>A consequence, and not a rare one, of this
practice, is the Hypochondrialgia, and if
those who are Hypochondriacs, from other
causes, abandon themselves to it, all the
symptoms of that disorder are exasperated by
it, and it becomes incurable. I have seen
the most cruel inquietude, agitations, anxieties
result from these two causes united; and
repeated observations have proved to me,
that, in those Hypochondriacs, who are subject
sometimes to attacks of delirium, or
frenzy, self-pollution always hastens on the
fits. The brain, weakened by this double
cause, successively loses its faculties, and the
patients fall at length into a state of an idiotism,
which is never interrupted but by some
attacks of madness.</p>

<p>The <i>Memoirs of curious Naturalists</i> mention
a melancholic man, who, in pursuance
of Horace’s advice, used, sometimes, to seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in wine, a diversion from his melancholy,
and who, in the honey-moon of his second
marriage, having indulged excessively the
pleasures of coition, fell into so dreadful a
frenzy, that it was necessary to chain him
down<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jakin</span>, in his Commentaries upon <span class="smcap">Rhazes</span>,
has preserved to us the history of a melancholic
man, whom excesses of that kind
threw into a consumption, attended with a
frenzy, which made an end of him in a few
days<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<p>It is well known that the epileptical paroxysms,
accompanied with an effusion of the
seminal liquid, leave a greater faintness and
stupor than other fits, without that symptom.
Coition will provoke and bring on the
fits of that disorder, in those who are subject
to it; and it is to this cause that M. <span class="smcap">Van
Swieten</span> imputes the great faintness into
which those fall, who have frequent returns
of those fits<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. The late M. <span class="smcap">Didier</span>
knew a merchant of Montpelier, who never
performed the act of coition without having
immediately after it an attack of the epilepsy<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.
<span class="smcap">Galen</span> makes the like observation<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.
The Observations of <span class="smcap">Henricus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
ab Heers</span>, not to mention many others,
attest the like effect<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Van Swieten</span> knew an epileptic
patient, who was attacked with a fit on his
wedding night<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> knew a woman, who was
very lewd, and who, for the most part, had
a fit of the epilepsy after every act of venery<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

<p>And here it may not be improper to introduce
what M. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> says, in his
treatise on the Disorders of the Nerves, that
in the venereal ardor, all the nerves are affected,
sometimes even to death. He mentions
the example of a woman, who, after
every coition, fell constantly into a pretty
long fainting fit; and that of a man, who
died in the act of his first coition, the force
of the spasm having instantaneously thrown
him into a total palsy. And I find in the
excellent work with which M. <span class="smcap">de Sauvages</span>
has lately inriched the physical
world, a most singular, and perhaps before
unheard of, case of a man, who, in the
midst of the act used to be attacked (and
this disorder lasted twelve years) with a
spasm, which threw his whole body into a
state of rigescence, with loss of sense: <i>Ita
ut illum præ oneris impotentia in alteram lecti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
partem excutere cogeretur uxor, ut evacuatio
spermatis lenta flaccidoque veretro demum succedebat,
remittente corporis rigiditate</i><a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>

<p>I know several cases which have some affinity
to this. M. <span class="smcap">de Haller</span> has specified
a great many, in his remarks on the Institutes
of <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span><a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>; and there are
numbers to be seen in the works of other
observers.</p>

<p>It has precedently been remarked, that
self-pollution would produce this dreadful
disorder, and that happens oftener than is
imagined: Can it then be surprizing, that
the acts of it should recall the fits, as I have
more than once seen it in persons subject to
the epilepsy; or is it strange that they should
render it incurable?</p>

<p>This total rigescence or inflexibility of the
body, of which M. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> makes
mention, is one of the most uncommon
symptoms; I never saw it above once, but
then it was in the most consummate degree.
The ill had begun by a stiffness of the neck
and spine, and successively spread to all the
limbs: this was the case of an unfortunate
young man, whom I saw some time before
his death. Uncapable of lying on the bed
in any other posture but the supine one, and
without power to move hand or foot, immoveable,
in short, and reduced to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
no aliments but as they were put into his
mouth; he languished a few weeks in this
deplorable condition, and died, or rather
went out like a taper, almost without any
indication of pain.</p>

<p>I have since seen another terrible example
of this total and mortal rigescence, which
will deserve a specification here.</p>

<p>On the 10th of February, 1760, I was
called to visit, in the country, a man of
about forty years of age, who had been very
strong and robust, but who had been guilty
of great excesses with women and wine, and
who had moreover often exercised himself
at trials of bodily strength. It was some
months precedently that his disorder had begun
by a weakness in his legs which made
him stagger as he walked, as if he had been
drunk. Sometimes he would actually fall
down, though on the plainest ground. He
could not descend any steps without a great
deal of trouble, and hardly durst stir
out of his apartment. His hands shook terribly;
it was with much difficulty he could
write a few words, and those sadly scrawled.
But he could dictate readily enough, though
his tongue, which had never had any great
volubility, began to have rather somewhat
less. His memory was good, and the only
thing that could make any detriment to his
intellects to be suspected, was, that he was
less attentive to the <i>game of draughts</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that his countenance was a good deal altered.
He had an appetite, and slept; but it was
with difficulty he could turn himself in his
bed.</p>

<p>It appeared to me, that his excesses with
women and wine were the primary cause of
his disorder, and I judged, that his straining
in his trials of bodily strength might be the
reason why his muscles were more particularly
attacked. The season was rather unfavorable
to the employment of remedies,
and yet it was requisite, in the mean while,
to stop the progress of the disease. I advised
him frictions of the whole body, with flannel,
and other corroboratives; proposing to
myself to augment the doses with the adjunction
of the cold-bath, in the beginning of
the summer. At the end of some weeks the
tremors of his hand appeared some what abated.
In the month of April there was a conciliation
held on him, in which his disorder
was imputed to an accident of his having,
about two years before, written, for some
months, in a room newly plaistered and
damp. Upon this there were applied warm
baths, unctuous frictions, powders said to be
diaphoretic and antispasmodic; but no alteration
for the better followed. In the
month of June, a second consultation decided
for his going to the baths of Leuk, in
Valais: he went, and on his return he had
more tremors, and a greater stiffness. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
then (September, 1760) till the month of
January 1764, I have not seen him above
three or four times.</p>

<p>In 1762, on the credit of some advertisement,
he sent for, from Frankfort, the medicines
of the <i>Onania</i>, which did him no
service. Last year, he took others from some
foreign physician, but with as little success.
His disorder had, from the beginning, made
slow but daily advances, and many months
before his death, he could no longer support
himself on his legs, nor could he so much as
move his hands or arms. The embarrassment
of his tongue increased, and his voice failed
him to such a degree, that there was no
hearing easily what he said. The extensor
muscles of the head let it continually fall on
the breast. He had constantly an uneasiness
in his back: his sleep and appetite successively
diminished: the last months of his life
he could hardly swallow any thing. Since
Christmas an oppression came on him, with
an irregular fever. His eyes grew dim in
a singular manner. When I saw him again
in the month of January, he used to pass the
whole day, and a great part of the night, in
an elbow-chair, leaning backward, his feet
extended on a chair, his head falling down
every instant on his breast, having always a
person standing near him, and constantly
employed in changing his attitude, lifting his
head up to feed him, to give him snuff, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
blow his nose; and to make out, by listening
attentively, what he said. The last days of
his life he was reduced to pronounce his
words letter by letter, which were taken
down in writing just as he could articulate
them. Finding that I gave him no hopes,
and that I only employed some lenitives for
his oppression and fever, urged, at length,
by a desire of living, he opened himself in,
confidence to one of his friends, for his immediately
acquainting me of it, as the cause
to which he imputed all his illness, and
which was his self-pollution, having begun
that infamous practice many years ago, and
continued it as long as he could; adding,
that he had felt this disorder increase in proportion
to his delivering himself up to it.
This confession he confirmed to me some
days afterward, and withal, that it was on
this account that he had been determined to
send for the medicines of the <i>Onania</i>.</p>

<p>Excess of venery does not only produce the
languors of chronical diseases, but sometimes
throws into acute ones, and always aggravates
any disorders that proceed from other
causes; it easily produces malignancies,
which, in my opinion, are but a failure of
the forces of nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>, in his histories of epidemical
diseases, has, of old, left us his observation
on a young man, who, after excesses
of wine and venery, was seized with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fever, accompanied by the most vexatious
and irregular symptoms, and which proved
mortal<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<p>All that M. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> says on this head
deserves a reference to it. After having
spoke of the danger of the pleasures of love,
for wounded persons, he examines that of
such as, having a fever, will nevertheless
venture upon them. He begins by quoting
an observation of <span class="smcap">Fabricius Hildanus</span>,
who says, that a man having had a commerce
with a woman, the tenth day of a
pleurisy, which had had a favourable crisis
from a profuse sweat, was attacked with a
violent fever and remarkable tremors, and
died the thirteenth day. He gives you afterwards
the history of a man of fifty years
of age, gouty, and much addicted to venery
and wine, who, in the first days of his recovery
from a false pleurisy, was attacked, immediately
after a coition, with a general tremor,
an excessive flushing in the face, a fever,
and all the symptoms of the disorder
from which he was recovering, but much
more violent than the first time, and was in
a much greater danger. He tells you too
of a man, who never indulged any venereal
excesses without having, for many days afterwards,
fits of an intermittent fever. He
concludes with a case from <span class="smcap">Bartholinus</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
who saw a new-married man attacked, on
the next morning of his wedding night, after
conjugal excesses, with an acute fever, a great
lowness of spirits, faintnesses, nauseas of the
stomach, an immoderate thirst, lightness of
head, want of sleep, and anxieties; but who
was cured by rest and some restoratives<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Chesneau</span> saw a young married couple,
attacked, the first week of their wedding,
with a violent continual fever, with a
flushing in the face, which was also considerably
swelled: both of them had a great pain
in the small of their back, and both perished
in a few days<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Vandermonde</span> describes a fever
produced by the same cause, a very tedious
fever, and attended with the most dreadful
symptoms, but of which the issue was more
happy than in the case adduced by <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>.
I will not here recite the description
of it, because of its length; but I earnestly
recommend to physicians the reading
it in the work itself, which is now easily to
be come at any where. I shall subsequently
and in another place speak of the method of
cure.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">de Sauvages</span> describes this disorder
under the title of the <i>burning fever of the
exhausted</i>: the pulse is sometimes strong and
full, at others weak and low. The urines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
are red, the skin dry and hot, the thirst considerable.
They have nauseas, and cannot
sleep<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1761 and 1762 I saw two young men
both very healthy, very strong, and vigorous,
who were attacked, the one on the
next morning the other on the next night of
their respective weddings, with a violent fever,
without any shudder, their pulse quick
and hard, lightness of head, many slight convulsive
motions, an intolerable restlessness,
and the skin very dry. The second was extremely
thirsty, and made water with great
difficulty. I imagined, at first, that an excess
of wine might have some share in these
accidents, but I was fully convinced to the
contrary, at least by the second. They were
both of them cured in about two days time,
a circumstance, which, joined to the epoch
of their disorder, and to its symptoms, leaves
no doubt about the cause of it.</p>

<p>Careful observations and sad experience
have taught me, that acute disorders were
always very dangerous in persons accustomed
to self-pollution; their progress is commonly
irregular, their symptoms unaccountable,
their periods interverted. The constitution
affords no resources; Art is obliged to do
every thing, and as it never procures perfect
<i>Crises</i>, when, after a great deal of pains, the
disease is got under, the patient remains rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in a state of languor than of recovery,
which exacts a continuation of the most assiduous
care, to hinder him from falling into
some chronical disorder.</p>

<p>I find that <span class="smcap">Fonseca</span> has already stated
this danger. “Many young persons (says he)
and those very robust ones, are either attacked,
after excesses with women, on the
same night, with an acute fever that kills
them, or fall into grievous disorders, of
which they find it a difficult matter to be
cured; for when the body is weakened
by venereal excesses, if it should be attacked
with an acute distemper, there is
no remedy<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.”</p>

<p>A young lad, not quite sixteen, had abandoned
himself to self-pollution, with such a
rage, that, at length, instead of seed, he only
brought blood, of which the emission was
soon followed by excessive pains, and by an
inflammation of all the organs of generation.
Happening to be in the country, I
was consulted. I ordered extremely emollient
cataplasms, which produced the effect
I expected from them: but I have since
learnt, that he died soon after of the small-pox;
and do not in the least doubt of the
hurt he did his constitution by the fury of
that infamous practice, having much contributed
to render that distemper mortal. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a warning should not this be to young people!</p>

<p>All those who have sometimes occasion to
have the venereal disorder under their cure,
know that it frequently becomes mortal, in
such as have had their constitution impaired
or worn out by frequency of debauchery.
I have seen the most deplorable objects in
that way.</p>

<h3>SECTION V.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Consequences of self-pollution to the female sex.</i></span></h3>

<p>The preceding observations appear, all
of them (except that from Mr. <span class="smcap">Stehelin</span>,
which concludes the second Section,)
to concern principally the men: but it would
be an essential imperfection, in a treatise on
this subject, to omit an admonition to the
female sex, of their exposing themselves to
the same dangers, on their pursuing the same
depraved course. There are numerous examples
of their having drawn upon themselves
all the evils I have set forth, and women
but too often perish miserably the victims
of this detestable lewdness. The English
treatise upon <i>Onania</i> is full of confessions
of this kind, which there is no reading without
being seized with horror and compassion;
the malignity of the disorders occasioned
by it, seems even to have a superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
degree of activity among the women, to
what it has among the men.</p>

<p>Besides the symptoms which I have already
described, the women are particularly
exposed to hysteric fits, or dreadful vaporous
affections; to incurable jaundices, to cruel
cramps of the stomach and back; to sharp
prickings of the nose, to the <i>fluor albus</i>, of
which the acridity is a perpetual source of
the most torturous pains; to the procidentia,
and ulcerations of the womb, and to all
the infirmities which are the consequences
of these two disorders; to elongations of the
clitoris, and eruptions on it; to the <i>furor
uterinus</i>, which, depriving them at once of
modesty and reason, puts them on a level
with the most lascivious brutes, till a desperate
death delivers them from pain and
infamy.</p>

<p>The face, that faithful mirror of the intellectual
and bodily affections, is the first to
give outward signs of the inward disorders.
Then that plumpness, that fresh color, whose
union constitutes that air of youth, which
alone can supply the place of beauty, and
without which beauty itself can produce no
other impression than that of a cold unconcerned
admiration; that plumpness, I say,
that fresh color, are the first to fade away
and disappear: leanness, a sallow complexion,
a coarseness of the skin succeed immediately
to them; the eyes lose their lustre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
tarnish, and express, in their languor, that
of the whole machine, the lips lose their
vermilion, the teeth their whiteness; in
short, it is not rare that the whole figure receives
a considerable damage by the total
deformation of the shape.</p>

<p>The <i>Rickets</i> is a disorder, as to which
<span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> is mistaken, when he says, it
does not attack persons after the age of three
years. It is not uncommon to see young people
of both sexes, but especially the female,
who, after their having been well-shaped
to the age of eight, ten, twelve, or fourteen,
and even sixteen years, fall, little by little,
into a distortion of shape, through the curvature
of the spine; and this disorder sometimes
becomes very considerable. It is not
here the place for entering into particulars
of this ailment, nor into an enumeration of
the causes which produce it. <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>
has pointed out two<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. I shall have,
perhaps, occasion of communicating, in another
work, what several observations have
taught me on that subject; but what I ought
not to omit here, is, that self-pollution holds
the first rank among the causes that produce
it.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> having already observed,
that young persons, who give themselves up
to the pleasures of venery before they have
attained their full growth, could not thrive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and must rather go back than advance in
their stature<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>, I only add, that it is obvious
to sense, that a cause which can hinder
growth, must, <i>a fortiori</i>, disturb the order,
and produce those irregularities in the course
of it, which contribute to the disorders of
which I am treating.</p>

<p>One symptom common to both sexes, and
which I place under this head, because it is
the most frequent among women, is that
indifference which this infamous habit leaves
for the lawful pleasures of the marriage-bed,
even while the desires of sensuality, and
strength are not yet extinguished; an indifference,
which does not only attach numbers
to a single life, but which often pursues even
to the nuptial couch.</p>

<p>In the collection of cases made by Dr.
<span class="smcap">Beckers</span>, a woman confesses, that this vile
habit had got such an ascendant over her
senses, that she had an aversion against the
lawful means of satisfying the desires of nature,
in the natural way.</p>

<p>I myself know a man, who being taught
these abominations by his tutor, had the
like distaste, on the first of his marriage;
and his anguish at this situation, joined to
the faintness contracted by that habit, threw
him into a profound melancholy, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
yielded, however, at length, to the nervous
and restorative remedies.</p>

<p>Here, before I proceed farther, let me
entreat fathers and mothers to make their
own reflections on the occasion of the misfortune
of this last mentioned patient; and
there are more examples than one of the
like case. If one may, to such a degree, be
deceived in the choice of those to whom the
important care of forming the head and
heart of young persons, what ought one not
to fear from those, who, being only designed
to give the corporal graces and talents of
education, are less scrupulously examined as
to their morals? And what ought not one
still more to fear from servants, too often
hired without any character of their morals
at all.</p>

<p>The young boy, or rather merely a child,
of whom I made mention from M. <span class="smcap">Rast</span>,
was, as has been remarked, seduced into
that vice by a maid-servant.</p>

<p>The English collection of cases of self-pollution
is full of the like examples; and I
could produce many instances of young plants
blasted and lost through the villainy of the
gardeners intrusted with their cultivation:
and, in that light, there are such gardeners
of both sexes.</p>

<p>What remedy, will it be said, is there for
such evils? The answer is out of my sphere;
I shall then make it a short one. The most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
scrupulous attention ought to be given to the
choice of a preceptor; nor ought the care
to end at that, but a watchful eye be kept
over him and his pupil; that sort of watchful
eye, which belongs to a sensible and careful
father of a family, and which discovers
the most hidden doings in every corner of
the house; that eye, I say, which discovers
those antlers of the stag, which escaped all
other eyes, a penetrative vigilance, in short,
from which nothing can be concealed, and
which it is possible to have, when one is in
earnest in it.</p>

<p class="noindent">Young persons ought never to be left alone
with masters liable to any suspicion; and all
intercourse should be forbidden with the
servants.</p>

<p>It is not long since that a girl of about
eighteen years of age, who had enjoyed a
very good health, fell into an astonishing
weakness; her strength decayed daily; she
was all the day stupified with a kind of dozing,
and all night tormented with a want
of sleep, her appetite was gone, and œdematous
swellings spread over her whole body.
She consulted an able surgeon, who, having
satisfied himself of there having been no disorder
in the menstrual flux, suspected self-pollution.
The effect of his first question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
confirmed to him the justness of his suspicion,
and the confession of the patient converted
it to a certainty. He made her sensible
of the danger of this practice, a cessation
of which, and some remedies, stopped,
in a few days, the progress of the evil, and
even produced some amendment of health.</p>

<p>Besides self-pollution, manual or instrumental,
there is another defilement, or contamination,
which may be termed <i>clitoridian</i>,
of which the known origin is traced
up to the second Sappho.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">A vice too common among the Roman women,

<p>Nature, in her sportive indulgence to variety,
gives to some women a degree of resemblance
to men, which, for want of sufficient
examination, has, for ages, obtained
a belief of that chimæra of Hermaphrodites.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
The supernatural size of a part which is
commonly a very small one of the female
organ of generation, and upon which M.
<span class="smcap">Tronchin</span> has given a learned dissertation,
constitutes the whole wonder, as the odious
abuse of that part does the whole ill. Vain,
perhaps, of this sort of resemblance, there
have been some of these imperfect women,
who have usurped the functions of virility.
The Greeks call them <i>Tribades</i>. They are
a sort of monstrous beings too frequent, and
which seduce the young of the fair sex with
the more facility, for their having in their
favor, that reason for loving eunuchs, which
Juvenal imputes to some women,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Quod abortivo non est opus.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There are not those consequences to be
dreaded, the impossibility of hiding which
betrays such as have had complaisances or
weaknesses in the natural way. Of this circumstance
the <i>Tribad</i> takes the advantage to
draw the young of her sex into the crime,
without her innocent accomplices even suspecting
the danger: and yet it is not less in
that way than in other means of pollutions;
the consequences are equally pernicious. All
these deviations from the course of nature
lead to weaknesses, languor, pain, and death.
This last kind of lewdness deserves the more
attention, for that it is, in our days, grown
frequent, and that it would not be difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
find more than one <i>Laufella</i>, more than one
<i>Medullina</i>, who, like those Roman heroines
in obscenity, think they should slight those
extraordinary gifts of nature, if they did not
pervert them to the confusion of the arbitrary
distinction of the sex to which they
were born. It is well known, that, some
years ago, at a certain court, a lady was so
much in love with a young girl to her taste,
that she conceived a violent jealousy against
a celebrated man of Literature, who had
conceived a liking for her.</p>

<p>But it is time to have done with these
melancholic instances of the depravity and
turpitude of human nature; I am mortified
and sick of describing them. I will not here
then accumulate a greater number of facts:
those which remain for me to specify, will
naturally find their place elsewhere. I shall
next pass to an examination of the causes of
the evils proceeding from this practice, after
first concluding this Section with the following
general observation.</p>

<p>It is this. Young people born with a
weak constitution, have, on a parity of
crimes, much worse consequences to fear,
than those who are naturally vigorous. None
escape punishment, but all do not experience
it equally severe. Those especially who
have reason to apprehend any hereditary
diseases by the father’s or the mother’s side;
such as are threatened with the gout, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
stone, the consumption, the king’s evil;
those who have any touches of a cough, of
an asthma, of spitting of blood, of head-achs,
of the epilepsy; those who have any
tendency to that kind of rickets which I
have precedently mentioned; all these unfortunates,
I say, ought to be intimately
persuaded, that every act of this sort of debauchery
gives a severe blow to his constitution,
most certainly hastens the attack of
the evils they dread, renders the fits infinitely
more vexatious, and will throw them,
in the flower of their youth, into all the infirmities
of the most languishing old age.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The <span class="smcap">Causes</span>.</i></span></h2>

<h3>SECTION VI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Importance of the seminal liquid.</i></span></h3>

<p>How comes it that an over-abundant
emission of seed produces all the evils
I have precedently described? This
is what I am actually proceeding to examine.
These causes may be reduced to two, to wit,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The privation of that liquid.</p>

<p>The circumstances accompanying the emission.</p>

</div>

<p>An anatomical particularisation of the organs
of this secretion; the conjectures, more
or less probable, on the process of nature in
that secretion; with observations on its sensible
qualities, would be so many points of
discussion misplaced here. To prove the
utility of that liquid to the human constitution,
is all that is essential to the purposes of
this work; and this is to be done by the testimonies
of the most eminent physicians,
including withal a determination of its effects
on the body.</p>

<p>The following Section will be appropriated
to an examination of the effects which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
are produced by the circumstances that accompany
the emission.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>,
that the seed was a secretion from the whole
body, but especially from the head. “The
human seed (says he) proceeds from all
the humors of the body, and is the most
essential part of them. This is proved by
the weakness, the faintness, which accompanies
the loss of it in the act of coition,
be the quantity never so small. There are
veins and nerves, which, from all the parts
in the body, concur to their centre in the
parts of generation; when these are turgid,
and genially heated, there is felt in
them a stimulation, or pruriency, which
communicating itself to the whole body,
carries with it an impression of pleasure
and glowing warmth; the humors enter
into a kind of fermentation, which separates
from them all that is the most precious
and balsamic in them; and this part
separated from the rest, is carried, by
means of the spinal marrow, to the organs
of generation<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Galen</span> adopts his ideas. “This humor”
(says he) “is but the most subtile, the most
refined part of all the others. It has its
proper veins and nerves, which carries it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
from the whole body, to the seminal repositories,
the testicles<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.”</p>

<p>In another place, he says: “The loss of
the seed is at the same time attended with
a loss of vital spirit, so that it is no wonder
that over-frequent coition should enervate
the constitution, since it deprives
the body of its purest essence<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.”</p>

<p>The same author has preserved to us, in
his History of Philosophy, the opinions of
several philosophers on this subject. May I
be allowed to recite them here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>, whose works of natural philosophy
will be in esteem as long as the value
of observations shall be known, with a
just allowance at once for the merit and the
difficulty of opening the career of them, calls
it “<i>the excretion of the ultimate aliment</i>,
(which, in terms more clear, signifies the
most perfectly elaborated part of our aliments)
<i>endowed with the faculty of reproducing bodies
in the likeness of that whereby it was itself
produced</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pythagoras</span> calls it, “<i>the flower, or
quintessence of the purest blood</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcmæon</span>, his disciple, a great naturalist
and an eminent physician, one of the first
that discovered the importance of dissecting
animals, and of all the heathen philosophers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
he that appears to have had the truest ideas
of the nature of the soul, <span class="smcap">Alcmæon</span>, I say,
calls the seed “<i>a portion of the brain</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plato</span> termed it, “<i>an emanation from
the spinal marrow</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Democritus</span> thought of it as <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>
and <span class="smcap">Galen</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epicure</span>, that respectable character, who
better knew than any one, that it was pleasure
alone that constituted the happiness of
man, but who at the same time fixed the
nature of those pleasures by such rules as the
Christian Hero would not disown, or object
to them: yes, <span class="smcap">Epicure</span>, whose doctrine
has been so cruelly disfigured and blackened
by the Stoics, that those who knew nothing
of him but through the chanel of their information,
have suffered themselves to be
misled by it in their opinion, to such a degree,
that they have mistaken for a libertine,
a debauchee, a man, “who (as M.
<span class="smcap">Fenelon</span> observes) was of an exemplary
continency, and whose morals were extremely
regular.” To which I shall add,
that his principles are the most severe censure
on the tenets of his <i>pretended</i> modern
sectaries, who knowing nothing of him but
his name, most basely and unworthily misuse
it, by employing it to authorise systems
of infamy, which he would abhor, and by
which those men of probity and sense, who
love the truth, ought not to permit his memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to be dishonoured, if so it was that
men, themselves lost to honour, could dishonour
any one. <span class="smcap">Epicure</span>, I say, looked
on the seed as a particle of the soul and the
body, and grounded, upon this idea, his
precepts for the chary preservation of it.</p>

<p>Though many of these opinions differ in
some measure, they all agree to prove how
precious this humor was held.</p>

<p>It has been a question whether it has any
analogy to any other humor? Or is it the
same with that liquid, which, under the
name of the animal spirits, conveyed by the
nerves, concurs to all the functions of the
animal machine that are of any, though
ever so little importance, and of which the
depravation produces such an infinity of evils,
so frequent and so unaccountable? To answer
this question positively, it would be requisite
first to know intimately the nature of
these two humors; and we are very far from
having as yet reached that degree of knowledge:
we can at best propose nothing more
than ingenious and probable conjectures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> says, “It is easy enough to
conceive how there is such a close alliance
between the brain and the testicles, since
both those organs separate from the blood
the most subtile and the most exquisite
lymph, destined to give force and motion
to the parts, and even to have an influence
on the functions of the soul. So that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
it is not possible but that an over-abundant
dissipation of these liquids should
destroy the strength of the mind and
body<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere he says, “That the seminal
liquid is like the animal spirits, which
are separated from the brain, distributed
through all the nerves of the body, and
seems to be of the same nature; whence
it comes, that the more of it is dissipated,
the less there is secreted of the animal
spirits.”</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">de Gorter</span> is in the same idea.
“The seed (says he) is the most perfect, the
most importantly essential of all the animal
liquids: it is also the most elaborate;
it is the result of all the digestions; its
intimate connection with the animal spirits,
proves that, like them, it draws its
origin from the most perfect humors<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.”</p>

<p>In short, it appears by these testimonies,
and by a croud of others which it would be
superfluous to quote, that it is a liquid of
the utmost importance; that it might be
called the <i>essential oil</i> of the animal liquids;
or, perhaps more correctly, the <i>spiritus rector</i>,
the dissipation of which leaves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
other humors weak, and, in some measure,
dead or vapid.</p>

<p>But whatever may be the original importance
of this humor, it may be objected,
that since it is separated from the others,
and deposited in its appropriate reservoirs, of
what use can it be to the body after this its
separation? It is granted, they will say, that
an over-abundant evacuation of those humors,
which are in actual circulation through
the vessels, and by that very circulation
contribute to nutrition, such as the blood,
the serosity, the lymph, &amp;c. may weaken;
but it is not so easy to conceive how a humor,
that is no longer in circulation, that is,
in a state of separation, can produce this
effect.</p>

<p>I answer, in the first place, that examples
of this kind, and too frequent not to
be generally known, ought to obviate such
an objection. Who might not have observed,
that an evacuation of milk (to go no
further than that instance) though moderate
and of no long duration, is capable of
weakening a nurse that has not a strong
constitution, to such a degree, that she may
feel the influences of it for the rest of her
life? And even the robustest would sink under
it, if continued beyond a certain length
of time. The reason is sensibly apparent.
Upon evacuating too often the reservoirs appropriated
to the reception of any liquid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the humors are, by a necessary consequence
of the laws of the animal machine, determined
to an afflux thither in the greater
abundance. This secretion becomes excessive,
all the others suffer by it, and especially
nutrition, which is but a kind of secretion;
the animal constitution falls into languor
and debility.</p>

<p>Secondly, There is an answer, relative to
the seed which does not hold as to the milk,
which is only a liquid simply nutritious, of
which an over-abundant secretion does no
detriment, but in so much as it diminishes
the quantity of humors: whereas the seed
is an active liquid, of which the presence
produces effects necessary to the play of the
organs, which ceases on its evacuation; a
liquid, of which, for that very reason, the
superfluous emission is detrimental, in a double
view. This requires explanation.</p>

<p>There are humors, such as those of the
sweat and perspiration, which leave the body
as soon as they are separated from the other
humors, and thrown out by the vessels of
circulation.</p>

<p>There are others, such as the urine, which,
after this separation and expulsion, are retained,
for a certain time, in reservoirs appropriated
for that purpose, and out of which
they are not discharged, but when they are
in a quantity great enough to excite, in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
reservoirs, an irritation that mechanically
forces them to void them.</p>

<p>There is a third sort of humors, which,
like the second, are separated and retained
in their respective reservoirs, not for the purpose
of being, at least intirely, evacuated,
but to acquire, in those reservoirs, a perfection
that renders them fit for new, or
other functions, when they return into the
mass of humors. Such, among others, is
the seminal liquid. Separated in the testicles,
it passes thence, by a duct of some
length, into the seminal vesicules, and being
constantly repumped by the absorbent vessels,
it is, successively, by little intervals, returned
into the total mass of the humors.
This is a truth demonstrable by many proofs.
One alone may suffice. In a healthy man,
the secretion of this liquid is continually formed
in the testicles: it flows into these reservatories
of which the capaciousness is very
limited, not perhaps great enough for what
is separated in one day; and yet there are
men so continent as not to evacuate any for
whole years. What would become of it, if
it was not continually disposed of, by its re-entry
through the vessels of circulation? A
re-entry, that is extremely facilitated by the
structure of all the organs that serve for the
separation, the conveyance, and the preservation
of this humor. The veins are there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
much more considerable than the arteries,
and that in such a proportion as is observed
no where else<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. It is probable then that
this resorption is not only made in the seminal
vesicules, but that it has already taken
place in the testicles, in the <i>epididymises</i>,
which are a kind of first reservatory appendant
to the testicles, and in the <i>vasa deferentia</i>,
or chanel by which the seed is conveyed
from the testicles to the seminal vesicules.</p>

<p>It was not unknown to <span class="smcap">Galen</span> that the
humors were inriched by the retained seed,
though he was not apprized of the mechanism.</p>

<p>“Every thing (says he) is full of it, with
those who abstain from venery; but there
is none of it to be found with those who
abandon themselves to excesses of that
sensuality.”</p>

<p>He then labors hard to discover why a
small quantity of that liquid can give so much
strength to the body; at length he decides,
“that it has an exquisite virtue, so that it
can with surprising quickness communicate
its energy to all parts of the body<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>He proves afterwards, by various examples,
that a small cause often produces great
effects, and at length concludes thus:
“Needs it be any wonder that the testicles
furnish a liquid of a nature to diffuse fresh
vigor over the whole body, when the
brain produces motion and sensation, and
the heart gives pulse to the arteries!”</p>

<p>I shall wind up this Section with what
one of the greatest men of the age (M. <span class="smcap">Haller</span>)
says on the seminal humor.</p>

<p>“The seed is kept in the seminal vesicules
till the man makes use of it, or that
nocturnal pollutions deprive him of it.
During all that time, the quantity there
is of it excites the animal system to the
venereal act; but the greatest quantity of
this seed, the most volatile, the most odorous,
that which has the most strength, is
repumped into the blood, and produces, at
its entrance into it, the most surprising
changes; the beard, the hair, calluses; it
alters the voice and manner: for it is not
age that produces in animals this change;
it is the seed alone that operates them, and
they are never remarked in eunuchs<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>How does the seed operate these effects?
Ay, that is a problem of which the solution
is not perhaps as yet mature. But this however
may, with great probability, be said, that
this liquid is a stimulative, a goad, that irritates
the parts with which it is in contact:
its strong odor, and the palpable irritation it
exercises on the organs of generation, leave,
as to that, no doubt; nor is it unconceivable
that these acrid particles, being continually
resorbed and removed with the humors,
should, slightly at least, but continually,
stimulate the vessels, which, by that
very means, contract themselves with the
more force; their action upon the fluids is
then the more efficacious, the circulation
the more animated, the more lively, the nutrition
the more exact, and all the other
functions executed in the more perfect manner
for it: whereas, when this aid is denied
or failed, several functions never display
themselves, or take place, which is the
case in eunuchs<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>; and all are defectively
performed, and the worse for that want.</p>

<p>Here then occurs a natural enough question;
it is this: How comes it that Eunuchs
are not afflicted with the same evils
as those who exhaust themselves by excesses
of venery?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>It is hardly possible to answer this question,
satisfactorily, till the end of the following
Section.</p>

<h3>SECTION VII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>An examination of the circumstances which accompany the emission.</i></span></h3>

<p>There are several evacuations which
are performed imperceptibly: all the
others, except one, are effected in a state of
perfect health, with a facility to which it is
owing that they have no influence over the
rest of the machine: the slightest motion of
the organ which contains the matter of them,
suffices for the expulsion. The excepted one
is the evacuation of the seed, towards which
nothing less is required than a general commotion,
a convulsion of all the parts, an augmentation
of quickness in the course of all
the humors, to dislodge and give it issue.</p>

<p>Can it be thought here too hazardous a
conjecture to look on this necessary concurrence
of the whole animal system, as a sensible
proof of the influence it has over the
whole body?</p>

<p>“Coition (says <span class="smcap">Democritus</span>) is a sort
of epilepsy.”</p>

<p>“It is (says M. <span class="smcap">Haller</span>) a most violent
action, bordering upon convulsion,
and which must therefore astonishingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
weaken, being detrimental to the nervous
system.”</p>

<p>It has been seen, in an observation precedently
set forth, that an emission was preceded
by actual convulsions, by a sort of epilepsy;
and the same observation furnishes
evident proof of the influence which those
violent emotions had on the unhappy man
who was subjected to them.</p>

<p>The immediateness of the faintness after
the act has to many appeared, and not without
reason, a proof, that it could not be
only the privation of the seed that occasioned
it; but what demonstratively proves how
much the spasm or convulsion must weaken,
is the weakness incident to those who are
afflicted with convulsive disorders: that
which follows the fits of epilepsy is sometimes
excessive.</p>

<p>It could be only to the spasm, or convulsion,
that the singular effect was to be imputed,
which coition had on one whose name
was <span class="smcap">Amman</span>, and whose history was preserved
to us by <span class="smcap">Platerus</span>. Being advanced
in years he had re-married, and being
about to consummate his nuptials, he was
seized with so violent a suffocation, that he
was obliged to discontinue the attempt. The
same accident returned every time that he
renewed the trial. He applied, upon this,
to a number of quacks. One of them, who
had made him take a great many of his pretended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
remedies, assured him that he had no
longer any danger to fear. On the faith of
his Æsculapius, he ventured upon a fresh
attempt. The same symptom was instantly
the consequence: however, full of confidence,
he would persist, and died in the act
itself, in the arms of his wife<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.</p>

<p>Those violent palpitations which sometimes
accompany that of coition, are also a
convulsive symptom. <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span> speaks
of a young man, to whom excesses of venery
and wine had occasioned, among other symptoms,
continual palpitations<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. And <span class="smcap">Dolæus</span>
knew one, who, in the act itself, was
seized with so violent a palpitation, that he
must have been suffocated if he had persisted<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.</p>

<p>The case of the child, above quoted, is
also a proof, (which did not escape the sagacity
of M. <span class="smcap">Rast</span>,) of the power of the
convulsive cause; since at that age he could
hardly evacuate any thing but the humor of
the prostates, and not genuine seed.</p>

<p>These remarks have fallen under the observation
of a number of good authors, who
have written upon this matter. <span class="smcap">Galen</span>
seems to have hit upon them, where he
says, “Pleasure itself weakens the vital
forces.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fleming</span> has not omitted the cause,
in his fine poem on the maladies of the
nerves:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Quin etiam nervos frangit quæcunque voluptas</i><a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sanctorius</span> positively establishes his assertion,
that the motions weaken more than
the emission of the seed: and it is surprising
that M. <span class="smcap">de Gorter</span>, his commentator,
should have sought to persuade the contrary.
The reason which he gives, in his
averment that these motions do not weaken
any more than any other motion, “<i>because
they are not convulsive</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> will persuade no
one. One example, could he produce it,
would not pass for a law of nature. <span class="smcap">Lister</span>,
<span class="smcap">Noguez</span>, <span class="smcap">Quincy</span>, who had commented
this work before him, are not of his opinion;
they attribute part of the danger to the
weakness that remains after the convulsions.
“Coition (says <span class="smcap">Noguez</span>) is itself a convulsion;
it disposes the nerves to convulsive
motions, and the slightest occasion consequently
produces them.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. A. Borelli</span>, one of the first creators
of physiology, had not looked upon them
in the same light as M. <span class="smcap">Gorter</span>. He is
clearly positive upon this article.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“This act (says he) is accompanied with
a sort of convulsive pathos, which carries
with it the most sensible affections of the
brain, and of the whole nervous system<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senac</span> specifically imputes to the
nerves the weakness which follows coition.</p>

<p>“The most likely cause (says he) of the
fainting fit which comes when an abscess
breaks in the interior of the abdomen, is
the action of the nerves then brought into
play. This is confirmed by the ejection,
or by the fits of faintness which follow the
effusion of seed; for it is only to the nerves
that this sinking can be imputed<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.”</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span><a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> attributes more to this
cause than to the other, in which he is of
the opinion of <span class="smcap">Sanctorius</span>. Where there
is convulsion, the nervous system is in a state
of tension, or, to say more correctly, in an
extraordinary degree of action, of which the
necessary consequence is an excessive relaxation.
Every organ, that has been wound up
beyond its natural pitch, falls beneath it;
and from that very fall must necessarily
result a bad performance of the functions
which depend on it; and as the nerves
have an influence over them all, there
is not one of the functions but what must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
be more or less disordered when the nerves
are weakened.</p>

<p>One reason, too, that may contribute to
the weakness of the nervous system, is the
augmentation of the quantity of blood in the
brain, during the venereal act; an augmentation
well demonstrated, and which has
gone sometimes so far as to produce an apoplexy.
Many examples of it are furnished
by observing practitioners, and <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span>
relates one of a soldier, who, in the rage of
lust with which he abandoned himself to this
act, died apoplectic in the very instant of
fruition. On being opened, the brain was
found full of blood. It is by this augmentation
of blood, that the reason is explained
of those excesses producing madness<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.
Such a quantity of blood distending the
nerves, enfeebles them: they can the less
resist impressions, and thence their weakness.</p>

<p>On a reflection upon these two causes, the
evacuation of the seed, and the concomitancy
of the convulsive motions, it is easy to
explain the disorder that must result from
the excess of them to the animal œconomy.
They may be ranged under three heads.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The depravation of the digestions.</p>

<p>The weakening of the brain and of the
nervous system.</p>

<p>The disordering of the perspiration.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall see that there is no chronical
disease that may not be deduced from this
triple cause.</p>

<p>“The relaxation proceeding from these
excesses, disorders the functions of all the
organs,” says one of the authors who has
written the most sensibly on the dietetic branch
of physic; and the digestion, the concoction,
the perspiration, and the other evacuations
become respectively faulty: thence results a
sensible diminution of strength, of memory,
and even of the understanding; a dimness
of the eye-sight, all the disaffections of the
nerves, all kinds of the gout and rheumatism,
an amazing weakness of the back, the
consumption, a feebleness of the organs of
generation, bloody urines, head-achs, and
a multitude of other disorders superfluous to
specify here; in short, nothing so much abridges
life as the abuse of the pleasures of
venery<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.</p>

<p>The stomach is the part the first affected
by all the causes of weakness: this
is owing to its being the part of which the
functions require the greatest perfection in
the organ. The others are, for the most
part of them, as much passive as active; the
stomach is almost intirely active; so that as
soon as its strength diminishes, its functions
grow disordered; an observable truth, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
combined with the variety of the first impressions,
often vexatious ones, produced
upon this instrument of digestion by what is
taken in at the mouth, combined too, I say,
with the immediately following observation,
will account for the frequency, the oddity,
the obstinacy of its ailments. It is of all the
parts of the body that which receives the
greatest number of nerves, and in which
therefore, by that very means, there must
be distributed the greatest quantity of animal
spirits. Whatever then weakens the
action of the one, and diminishes the quantity
or depraves the quality of the other,
must in course more diminish the strength
of the stomach than of any other intestine;
and this is what happens in excesses of venery.
The importance of the function to
which it is destinated, is the cause, that
when it is ill or deficiently performed, all
the others feel it, and are the worse for it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Hujus enim validus firmat tenor omnia membra;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>At contra, ejusdem franguntur cuncta dolore.</i><a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From the moment that the digestions are
imperfectly performed, the humors assume
a character of crudity, which disqualifies
them for all their destinations, but which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
above all, hinders nutrition, upon which depends
the reparation of the vital forces. To
be assured of the general influence of the
stomach, there needs only to observe the
state of a person under the complaint of a
laborious digestion; his strength fails in a
few minutes; a general uneasiness renders
that weakness still harder to be indured; the
organs of sensation grow obtuse; the soul
itself cannot exercise its faculties but imperfectly;
the memory, and especially the imagination,
seem annihilated; nothing, in
short, makes a man of sense so nearly resemble
a fool, as a painful or defective digestion.</p>

<p>A very curious observation, specified by
M. <span class="smcap">Payva</span>, a Portuguese physician, who
resided in Rome, throws a great light on the
prodigious weakness into which an excessive
indulgence of venery will throw those who
are guilty of it.</p>

<p>“When (says he) the desires of the sensual
joy are, in young people, risen to the
greatest height, they feel a kind of agreeable
sensation at the orifice of the stomach;
but if they satisfy these desires
with too great an impetuosity, and beyond
their strength, they feel, in the same place,
an extremely disgustful sensation, with
something of a bitterness in it they cannot
express; they pay dearly besides for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
their excesses, by the leanness and marasmus,
&amp;c. into which they fall<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aretæus</span> had, before him, taken notice
of this truth<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>, and <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> employs
the same expressions as <span class="smcap">Payva</span>, with
this addition, that that sense of pain goes off
in proportion as they recover their strength<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.
He informs, in another place, the same thing,
joining thereto a very useful practical rule,
which is, that on the coming on of epileptic
fits, after venereal excesses, care should be
taken to strengthen the nerves of the stomach<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, The weakness of the nervous
system, which disposes to all the paralytic
and spasmodic accidents, is produced, as I
have before observed, by the convulsive motions
which accompany the emission, and,
in the second place, by the disorder of the
digestions: when these are faulty, the nerves
suffer by it, and suffer the more, for that
the fluid with which they are imbibed, being
the very ultimate elaboration of coction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and that which requires the greatest perfection
of that elaboration; when, I say, that
coction is faulty, it is of all the animal fluids
that which is thereby the most sensibly affected,
and upon which the crudity of the
rest of the humors has the most influence.
In short, what augments this weakness, is
an evacuation of a humor that has great affinity
to the animal spirits, and which, by
reason of that affinity, cannot be evacuated
without diminishing the strength of the nervous
system, which I cannot help attributing
to those spirits, notwithstanding the modest
doubts of some great men, who dare
not affirm any thing, in natural philosophy,
the truth of which does not fall under the
senses, and notwithstanding the objections
of some subaltern or systematical physiologists.</p>

<p>Besides: independently of the damage resulting
from this evacuation, relatively to the
quantity of the animal spirits, it hurts, by
its depriving the vessels of that gentle stimulation
produced by the absorbed seed, and
which contributes so much to the coction of
those spirits. It is pernicious, then, both
by its drawing off a part of the animal spirits,
or, at least, of a very pretious humor,
and by diminishing the coction, without
which those spirits can, at best, be only imperfectly
and insufficiently prepared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>There is between the diseases of the stomach
to those of the nerves, and from those
of the nerves again to those of the stomach,
a vitious circle. The first beget the second,
and these, once formed, contribute infinitely
to augment them. If daily observation were
not to prove it, the bare anatomical inspection
of the stomach would carry sufficient
conviction with it. The quantity of
nerves distributed through it, is abundantly
a demonstration how necessary they are to
its functions, and how, consequently, those
functions must be disordered when the nerves
are not in good condition.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Perspiration does not proceed
kindly in that case. <span class="smcap">Sanctorius</span> has
even determined the quantity diminished
by it; and this evacuation, the most considerable
of all the others, cannot be suppressed
without there resulting from it a
croud of different symptoms.</p>

<p>It is easily then conceivable that there can
be no disorder which may not be produced
by this triple cause. I will not enter into
the explanation of all the particular symptoms;
such a particularization would too
much expand this little work, and could not
interest the physicians to whom it would be
superfluous. What M. <span class="smcap">de Gorter</span> has
said upon it, is worth consulting<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Clifton Wintringham</span> has very
sensibly particularised the dangers of this
evacuation with respect to the gouty, and his
explanation merits attention<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<p>The late M. <span class="smcap">Gunzius</span>, snatched from
the medical career in the flower of his age,
has given a very ingenious mechanical explanation<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
of the inconveniences resulting
from this excess to the faculty of respiration.
He speaks, on this occasion, of a man who
had thereby brought upon himself a continual
cough; a symptom which I myself observed
in a young man who died a victim of
self-pollution.</p>

<p>He was come to Montpelier, to pursue
there his studies. His excesses in that infamous
practice had thrown him into a consumption,
and I recollect that his cough
was so strong and so continual, that it disturbed
all his neighbours. He was frequently
blooded, which must have been, I
supposed, by way of making the quicker
dispatch of his sufferings. A consultation on
his case, prescribed his going home, and
living there upon turtle-broth. His residence
was, if I am not mistaken, in Dauphiny.
The persons consulted promised him a complete
cure; but he died two hours after the
consultation. How curious an one! and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
what physicians must they have been who
were consulted!</p>

<p>But what is the least easy to conceive, or
rather, what is beyond all comprehension, is,
that of its prodigious weakening of the faculties
of the soul.</p>

<p>The solution of this problem is connected
with the question undeterminable by us, of
the mutual influence of the two substances
upon each other, upon which we are reduced
to the observation of these phenomenons,
without being able to account for
them. We are ignorant of the nature both
of the spirit and of the body; but we know
that they are so intimately united, that all
the changes that the one undergoes are felt
by the other: a circulation a little more or
less quick, the blood a little more or less
thick, some ounces more or less of aliments,
the same quantity of one aliment rather than
of another, a dish of coffee instead of a glass of
wine, a sleep more or less long or tranquil, a
stool a little more or less copious, a perspiration
too profuse or too languid, will totally change
our manner of seeing or judging of objects:
From one hour to another, the revolutions of
the machine bring with them different sensations,
different thoughts, and, arbitrarily,
form to us new principles of vices and of virtues;
so just is the idea of the poet who first
wrote Satires in France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Observation also teaches us, that of all
the diseases there is not one that affects more
quickly the soul, than those of the nervous
system: of this the epileptics, who, at the
end of a certain number of years, most commonly
fall into a state of imbecillity, furnish
a melancholy proof, which may, at the same
time, give us to understand, that it is not at
all surprising that those acts, which, as has
been precedently remarked, are always in a
small degree epileptic, should produce such
a weakening of the brain, and, consequentially,
of the vital faculties.</p>

<p>The weakening of the brain, and of the
nervous system, is followed by that of the
senses, which is nothing but natural.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sanctorius</span>, <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span>, and some
others, have endeavoured at explaining why
the sight more especially suffers; but their
reasons, however founded on truth, do not
appear to me sufficient. The principal ones,
and which are drawn from qualities particular
to this organ, are, the multitude of parts
that constitute the eye, and which being, all
of them, susceptible of different ailments,
render it infinitely more subject than the
others, to disorders. In the next place the
nerves serve here for various uses, and are
very numerous. In short, the afflux of humors
to that part, during the time of the
act, an afflux of which the sparkling perceived
in the eyes of animals, at that juncture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
forms a sensible proof, produces in the
vessels of the eye, at first a weakness, and
afterwards obstructions, of which a loss of
sight is the necessary consequence.</p>

<p>Nor is it actually difficult to answer the
question above proposed, why it is that Eunuchs,
who have no seed, are not exposed to
the disorders we have precedently described?</p>

<p>Of this there are two very sufficient reasons.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> is, that if Eunuchs do not
actually draw from this liquid those advantages
which are produced by its being prepared
and resorbed; on the other hand, they
lose nothing of that precious part of the
blood which is destined to become seed. It
is true, they do not experience those changes
which are owing to the preparation of the
seed, and which have been above set forth;
but then again, they cannot be exposed to
the evils which proceed from a privation of
this non-prepared humor. The seed, if I
could have leave to employ terms of metaphysic,
is either seed imperfect, and <i>in fieri</i>,
or seed <i>in potentia</i>; which is that precious
part of the humors separated by the testicles,
and seed actually made, or <i>in actu</i>. If the first
is not separated, the animal machine is deprived
of the advantages it draws from the
seed prepared, and does not undergo the
changes which depend on it, but then it is
not depauperated: it does not gain, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
neither does it lose; the body remains in a
sort of state of puerility. When the seed is
separated and evacuated, it is then a privation,
a real impoverishment.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> reason is, that the Eunuchs
escape that kind of spasm or convulsion, to
which I have imputed a great part of the
evils which are the consequence of excesses
in this way.</p>

<p>The accidents which, on the like account,
befall the women, are to be accounted for in
the like manner with those of the men.
The humor which they lose being less precious,
less elaborate, than the seed of the
man, the loss of it does not perhaps so
quickly produce a weakness; but when they
go to excesses, the nervous system being, in
them, weaker, and naturally more disposed
to spasm or convulsion, the fits are more
violent. Sudden excesses will throw them
into fits somewhat a-kin to those of the
young man whom I mentioned at the end
of the fourth section. I have also seen a
melancholic instance of this kind.</p>

<p>In 1746 a girl of the age of about twenty
three years challenged, to the combat of venery,
six Spanish dragoons, and bore their
assaults for a whole night in a house at the
gates of Montpellier. In the morning she
was brought into the town, dying, and weltering
in her own blood, which issued from
the womb. It would have afforded matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of instruction, to have been satisfied whether
that effusion of blood was the consequence
of some hurt, or whether it depended on the
dilatation of the vessels, by the augmentation
of the action of the womb.</p>

<h3>SECTION VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Causes of the dangers particular to self-pollution.</i></span></h3>

<p>It has been precedently observed, that
self-pollution is more pernicious than excesses
with women. Those who, on every
occasion, bring a particular Providence into
play, will assign for a reason, that it is the
special will of God, in punishment of this
crime. Persuaded as I am, that bodies have
been, primordially from their creation, subjected
to laws, which necessarily regulate all
their motions, and of which the Deity does
not probably change the œconomy, unless
in a small number of reserved cases, I should
not chuse to have recourse to miraculous
causes, but when there is found a manifest
opposition to natural ones. This is not the
case here: every thing may be very well explained
by the laws of the mechanism of
the body, and by those of its union with
the soul.</p>

<p>This common custom of a recourse to supernatural
causes, has been anciently combated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
by <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>, who speaking of
a disease which the Scythians imputed to its
being a particular punishment inflicted by
God, makes this fine reflexion:</p>

<p>“It is true (says he) that this disease
comes from God; but not, in any other
sense, than as all other diseases come from
him: one does not come from him more
than another; because all of them follow
his laws of nature, by which every thing
is governed<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sanctorius</span>, in his Observations, furnishes
us with one primary cause of this particular
danger:</p>

<p>“Moderate coition (says he) is rather of
service, when it is sollicited by nature:
when it is sollicited by the imagination, it
weakens all the faculties of the soul, and
especially the memory<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.”</p>

<p>It is not difficult to explain the cause of
this. Nature, in a state of health, does not
inspire with desires, but when the seminal
vesicules are full of a quantity of liquor,
which has acquired a degree of inspissation,
that renders the resorption of it the more
difficult; which is a sign that the evacuation
of it will not sensibly weaken the body. But
such is the organisation of the parts of generation,
that their action, and the desires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
consequential thereto, are not only put into
play, by the presence of a redundancy of seminal
humor, but the imagination has also
a great influence over those parts. Imagination
can, by laying itself out for the excital
of desires, and by busying itself with objects
present, or of its own formation, put
the parts into a state which produces those
desires, and those desires impell to an action,
so much the more pernicious for its being
the less necessary.</p>

<p>It is, with regard to this organ of a natural
necessity, as it is with regard to all the
others, who are never beneficially brought
into play, but when they are so by nature
herself. Hunger and thirst point out the
need of a recourse to meat and drink; but if
more is taken of them than these sensations
require, the surplusage hurts and weakens
the body. The need of going to stool or
urine are equally limited to certain natural
conditions; but a bad habit may so far pervert
or deprave the constitution of those organs,
that the necessity of evacuation will
cease to depend on the quantity of matters
to be evacuated. Men subject themselves to
false wants, and such is the case of those addicted
to self-pollution. It is imagination
and habit that sollicit them; it is not nature.
They rob nature of what is necessary
to her, and of which, for that very reason, she
is so chary, and loath to part with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>In short, in consequence of this law of the
animal œconomy, that humors will tend to
where there is an irritation, so it will happen,
that, after a certain time, there will be
a continual afflux of humors to the irritated
parts of generation: that case will come into
existence, which <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span> has already
observed, “When a man exercises the act
of coition, the seminal veins dilate, and
attract the seed<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.”</p>

<p>It may be remarked here, that there is in
self-pollution particularly a danger for children
before they arrive to the age of puberty.
It is happily not common to find
such monsters, of either sex, as to debauch
children before that epoch; but it is but
too common for children of that age to debauch
themselves. A great number of circumstances
may concur to keep a lewd commerce
with others at a distance from them,
or at least to moderate it; but a solitary
lewdness meets with no obstacle, and knows
no bounds.</p>

<p>A second cause is, the tyranny which this
odious practice gains over the senses, and
which the author of the <i>English Onania</i> describes
very justly.</p>

<p>“This impurity has no sooner subdued
the heart, than it pursues the criminal
every where: it takes hold of him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
engrosses his thoughts at all times and in
all places: in the midst of the most serious
occupations, even in acts of devotion,
he is in prey to sensual desires and to
lascivious ideas, which never leave him
free<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.”</p>

<p>Nothing can be more infeebling than this
continual stretch of the mind, ingrossed by
the same object. The self-pollutor, perpetually
abandoned to his obscene meditations,
is, in this regard, something in the case of
the man of letters, who fixes all his attention
on one point, and it is rare that such an
excess is not pernicious. That part of the
brain which is then in action, makes an effort,
which may be compared to that of a
muscle long and violently on the stretch:
thence results, either such a mobility, that
there is no stopping the activity of the part,
which is notably the case of self-pollution,
or an incapacity of action. Exhausted, at
length, by a continual fatigue, these wretched
beings fall into all the diseases of the
brain; melancholy, catalepsy, epilepsy, imbecillity,
loss of sense, weakness of the nervous
system, and a croud of the like evils<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>This cause of disorder does an infinite
mischief to a number of young people, in
that, when even their faculties are not as
yet extinct, the use of them is perverted.
To whatever vocation they devote themselves,
there is no making a proficiency in
any thing, without a degree of application,
of which this pernicious habit renders them
incapable. Among even those who dedicate
themselves to nothing, and the class of these
is but too numerous, there are some, whom
that vacuity more than commonly misbecomes;
an air of absence, of embarrassment,
of giddiness, adds to the circumstance of
their being good for nothing, that of their
being disgustfully so.</p>

<p>I could point out some, whom this incapacity
of fixing themselves to any thing,
combined with the diminution of their faculties,
disables from ever being of any use or
value in society. Melancholic condition!
which sinks the man beneath the brute, and,
very justly renders an object rather of contempt
than of pity to his fellow-creatures!</p>

<p>From these two causes there necessarily
results a third; and that is the frequency itself
of the act. As soon as the habit has
gained a little strength, both body and soul
concur in sollicitation to this crime. The
soul, immersed in obscene ideas, is almost
constantly exciting to lascivious acts, and if
ever she is, for some moments, interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
by other thoughts, the acrid humors, which
irritate the organs of generation, soon recall
her attention, and drag her back again to
her mire.</p>

<p>How fit would these truths, collected from
observation, be to check youth, if they could
but foresee that in this case one false step
would bring on another; that they will become
slaves to the temptation; that in proportion
as the motives of their seduction increase,
that reason of theirs, which ought to
restrain them, will grow weaker and weaker;
and that they will, in a little time, find
themselves cast away in a sea of misery,
without, perhaps, the aid of any the least
plank, to bring them to the shore again.</p>

<p>If sometimes their beginning infirmities
give them strong and salutary advice, if the
danger terrifies them for some moments,
their rage of debauchery replunges them
again, so that it may well be said of them,</p>

<p>While I studied in Geneva, a time, of
which the remembrance will be dear to me
for the rest of my life, one of my condisciples
was come to that state of horror, that
he was not master enough of himself to abstain
from these abominations, even during
the time of the lessons. He did not wait
long for his punishment: and perished miserably
of a consumption, in about two years
time. A similar case to this may be found
in the <i>Onania</i>.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The ingenious author, who, from the Latin
edition of this work, furnished the extract
in the excellent Latin Journal of Literature,
which, about a twelvemonth, made
its first appearance at Berne, tells you, with
regard to this observation, that a whole college
had recourse to this filthy practice, by
way of an amusement, to avoid falling asleep,
at the lessons of scholastic metaphysics,
which a very old professor used to teach
them, as he nodded between sleeping and
waking<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. But this little story seems to
me less fit to prove what I have been physically
advancing, than the actual horrid dissoluteness
into which the contagion of example
may plunge a number of young people.
The same author has recently published a
work, which I have not as yet had the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of perusing, but to which an excellent
judge assigns a rank among the best
productions of this age. There he mentions,
that, in a certain town, there was some
years ago discovered a whole society of wicked
boys, from fourteen to fifteen years old,
who met to practise this vice, and that a
whole school was to this moment infected
with it.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The health of a young Prince was daily
declining, without any one’s being able to
discover the cause of it. At length his surgeon
suspected it, watched him, and surprized
him in the fact. He confessed, that
one of his <i>valets de chambre</i> had taught him
the practice, and that he had been often
guilty of it. The habit was so strong upon
him, that the most pressing considerations,
and the most strenuously inforced, could not
break him of it. The evil was constantly
gaining ground; his strength was daily wasting;
and there was no such thing as saving
him, but by keeping guard over him, so as
not to let him be a moment out of sight, for
above eight months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>A patient, in one of his letters, gave me
a lively description of the difficulties of his
victory.</p>

<p>“There are great efforts (these are his
terms) required to conquer a habit, that is
every instant urging its recalls to us. I
own to you, with blushes, that the bare
sight of a female, no matter what she is,
is enough to excite my desires. I do not
even need that provocative; my polluted
imagination is but too ready to present
constantly to me objects of concupiscence.
It is true that this passion never rekindles
in me without my remembring, at the
same time, your good advice: I struggle
with myself; but even that struggle fatigues
and exhausts me. If you could but
find and suggest to me the means of diverting
my thoughts from such objects, I
believe my cure would be soon effected.”</p>

<p>It has been seen, in my extract from the
English <i>Onania</i>, that a frequent repetition
had produced in a woman the <i>furor uterinus</i>.
The habit of being ingrossed by one idea
renders one incapable of having any others;
it usurps the sole dominion of the mind, and
reigns despotically. The organs constantly
irritated contract a morbific disposition, which
becomes an ever present goad, independent
of all external cause. There are disorders of
the urinary passages which give a constant
tendency to make water; the reiterated irritation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the organs of generation produces
a disorder, in its way, analogous to that.
It is therefore not surprizing if the concurrence
of these two causes, moral and natural,
combined, should throw one into that horrid
disorder: and how powerful ought this
idea to be, for inspiring a salutary terror to
all in any danger of being in this case, and
who have as yet any traces of reason or
shame left!</p>

<p>A fourth cause to self-pollutors of their
waste of strength, is, that independently of
their frequency of emissions of seed, that
frequency of their erections, though imperfect
ones, of which they complain, considerably
exhausts them. Every part, that is in
a state of tension, produces an expence of
the vital forces, and they have none to spare:
the animal spirits croud thither in the greater
abundance, and dissipate themselves. This is a
great cause of weakness: they are proportionably
deficient in the other functions, which are,
in course, thereby imperfectly executed; and
the concurrence of these two causes has the
most dangerous consequences.</p>

<p>Another mischief, to which this fourth
cause subjects self-pollutors, is a sort of paralytical
affection of the organs of generation,
whence follow impotency, incapacity of
erection, and the simple gonorrhœa; for, the
relaxed parts suffer the true seminal liquid
to come from them as fast as it arrives, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the humor separated by the prostates to keep
continually oozing, and, in short, all the internal
membrane of the urethra acquires a
catarrhous disposition to furnish a gleet,
much of the same nature as the <i>fluor albus</i>
in women: a catarrhous disposition, which,
let me here somewhat digressively remark,
is less rare and more general to the parts of
the human body than is commonly imagined;
not being confined to the membrane
that invests the nostrils, the throat, the
lungs, but which often attacks all the cavities
of the intestines, where the disease is
not discerned, because not suspected, and
must, for want of that knowledge, be improperly
prescribed for: nor would it be difficult
to collect, from various medical observations,
examples of this disorder having
been mistaken for some other, and attempted
to be cured accordingly.</p>

<p>An able surgeon, once, mentioned to me
a man, who, from a singularity of taste, used
to indulge his debauchery with the lowest
street-walkers, and being accustomed to satisfy
his desires with them, in a standing posture,
against some wall or bulk, fell into a
wasting, accompanied with the most cruel
pains of his loins, and with an atrophy or
shrivelling of his thighs and legs, combined
with a palsy in those parts, which seemed
to be a consequence of the attitude in which
he used to indulge his dirty amours. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
having kept his bed about a month, he died
in a condition equally fit to inspire compassion
and terror.</p>

<p>But does not this observation furnish also
a fifth cause of the dangers particular to self-pollution?</p>

<p>When one loses one’s strength by two
means at once, the weakness must be considerably
augmented. A person who is standing
upright, or sitting, has need for the supporting
himself in those postures, and especially
in the first, of putting into action a
great number of the muscular parts; and
this action dissipates the animal spirits. Weak
persons, who cannot keep, for an instant, in
a standing posture, without feeling a weakness,
and the sick, that cannot sit up without
the like uneasiness, very evidently prove
this. But in lying down, or in the being
extended at full length, there is not required
the same strain on the vital strength. Thence
it is clear enough, that the same act, performed
in the one or in the other attitude,
will produce a much greater weakening in
the first than in the last case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sanctorius</span> has not failed to point out
the danger of this attitude: “<i>Usus coïtus
stando, lædit, nam musculos et eorum utilem
perspirationem diminuit.</i>”</p>

<p>Other observations, well examined, afford
a sixth cause, which may, at the first superficial
view, appear of the slightest, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
which no intelligent naturalist will readily
pronounce null.</p>

<p>All living bodies perspire. Every instant
there exhales through, perhaps, one half of
the pores of our skin, a humor of extreme
tenuity, and which is a great deal more considerable
than all our other evacuations: at
the same time, another kind of pores admit
a part of the fluids which surround us, and
convey them into the vessels. These are <i>the
invisible torrents</i> (to use M. <span class="smcap">Senac</span>’s happy
expression) that have their egress and regress
into our body<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. It stands demonstrated,
that, in some cases, this insorption is enormous.
The strong and healthy perspire the
most: the weak, who have hardly any atmosphere
of their own, inhale more. Now
the miasms, or perspired matter of healthy
persons, contains something nutritious and
corroborative, which inhaled by another,
contributes to give him vigor. These are
observations, which explain why the <i>young
virgin</i>, selected to cherish <span class="smcap">David</span>, by lying
in his bosom, gave him strength; why the
same experiment has succeeded with other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
old men, to whom it had been prescribed;
why that process weakens the young person,
who loses, without receiving anything; or
rather receives, in return, faint, sickly, corrupt,
putrid exhalations, which cannot but
be noxious.</p>

<p>Now, in the time of coition, people perspire
more than at any other, the force of
the circulation being augmented. This perspiration
is also, probably, more active, more
spirituous, than at any other time: it is a
real loss that is, on that occasion, sustained,
and which takes place, in whatever manner
the emission of the seed is made, as it depends
on the agitation that accompanies it.
In coition it is reciprocal, and then, the one
inhales what the other perspires. This exchange
stands unquestionably proved by sure
observations. I saw myself, not long ago,
one, who having no gonorrhœa, no cutaneous
symptom of the <i>lues</i>, had given the venereal
distemper to a woman, who, at that
instant was giving him the itch in exchange.
In coition, then, there is a sort of mutual
compensation of loss on both sides. But in
the case of self-pollution, the person guilty
of it loses, and in lieu of his loss, receives
nothing.</p>

<p>An observation of the effect of the passions
discovers a seventh cause of evil, in the
difference between those who indulge themselves
with women, and the self-pollutors;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a difference which is intirely to the disadvantage
of these last.</p>

<p>That joy which is allied to the soul, and
which it is so very right essentially to distinguish
from that merely corporal pleasure,
in which the man shares but with the brute,
and from which it is totally different; that
joy, I say, aids the digestions, animates circulation,
favors all the functions, restores
the vital forces, cherishes, and supports
them. Where it is found combined or united
with the pleasures of love, it contributes
to repair that strength which those pleasures
may have diminished or exhausted. This
stands proved by observation. <span class="smcap">Sanctorius</span>
has remarked it.</p>

<p>“A man (says he) after an excessive coition
with a woman he loves, and has passionately
desired, does not feel that fatigue
of weakness which one would naturally
suppose would be the consequence of such
an excess; because the joy of the soul augments
the power of the heart, favors the
functions, and repairs the losses.”</p>

<p>It is upon this principle that <span class="smcap">Venette</span>,
in whose work there may be seen a good
chapter on the dangers of pushing the pleasures
of love to an excess, establishes it as a
maxim, that an union with a beautiful woman
is less apt to exhaust the strength, than
with a homely one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beauty (says he) has charms which dilate
the heart, and multiply the vital spirits,
that proceed from it. We may very
well believe, with St. <span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span>,
that to excite one’s self repugnantly to the
laws of nature, is, in that respect, a much
greater crime than the other.”</p>

<p>And, in fact, can there be a doubt of
Nature’s not having annexed more joy to
the pleasures procured by the means which
are in her appointed course, than by any
which are out of it?</p>

<p>An eighth and last cause which augments
the dangers of self-pollution, is the regrets,
the horrors, which cannot fail of being the
consequence of it, when once one’s eyes
come to be opened on the crime and its
dangers.</p>

<p class="noindent">And, surely, if there are any human beings

<p>When the veil is drawn, the representation
of their conduct appears to them in all
its most hideous colors and aspects. They
find themselves guilty of a crime, of which
divine justice would not postpone the punishment,
but punished it immediately with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
death; a crime reputed a very great one

<p>The shame that pursues them infinitely
augments their misery. Such, it is true, is
the dissoluteness in some places, that debauches
with women are hardly looked upon
there, but as matter of custom; the guilty
of them make no mystery of it, and have no
notion of their being the more contemptible
for it: But where is the self-pollutor that
dares avow his infamy? Ought not this necessity
of wrapping himself up in the shades
of secrecy, appear, in his own eyes, a proof
of the criminality of this act? What numbers
have not perished for their never having
dared to reveal the cause of their evils?</p>

<p>It appears a natural sentiment in several
letters of the <i>Onania</i>, “<i>I would rather die
than appear before you, after such a confession.</i>”</p>

<p>And indeed one cannot help being infinitely
more ready to excuse a man, who being
seduced by that inclination which Nature
has ingraved on all hearts, and of which
she makes use for the preservation of the
species, is in no wrong but that of not respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the boundaries set by the laws, and
by health. He is one carried away by his
passions, and who is wanting to himself. We
are much more willing to absolve such an
one, than him who in his sin violates all
the laws of Nature, perverting all her sentiments,
and disappoints all her ends. Sensible
of how great a horror he must be in to
society, if his crime was known, that idea
alone must incessantly torment him.</p>

<p>“It seems to me (says one of these criminals,
a fragment of whose letter I have
above quoted) as if every one could read
in my face, the infamous cause of my ailments,
and this idea renders company insupportable
to me.”</p>

<p>They fall into melancholy and despair;
of which examples may have been seen in
the fourth Section of this work, and they
labor under all the evils that are brought on
by a continuity of dejection or sadness, without
having, and this is dreadful indeed for
a criminal, any pretext of justification, any
motive of comfort. And what are the effects
of such a melancholy? A relaxation of
the fibres, a lentor of the circulation, imperfection
of the digestions, a deficient nutrition,
obstructions occasioned by those
shrinkings or contractions which most particularly
seem the effect of sadness or melancholy:
[“the strainers of the liver, says <span class="smcap">Senac</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
close themselves, and the bilious
overflow spreads over the whole body:”]
spasms, convulsions, palsies, pains, increase
of anguish <i>ad infinitum</i>; with all the train
of evils consequential to these.</p>

<p>It would be superfluous to enlarge more
here on the dangers particular to self-pollution:
they are but too real, and too self-evident:
I proceed to the last part of this
work, the methods of cure.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="ARTICLE_III">ARTICLE III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Curative Indication.</span></span></h2>

<h3>SECTION IX.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Means of Cure proposed by other Physicians.</i></span></h3>

<p>There are some diseases against
which the success of remedies is
next to sure. Those which are the
consequences of venereal exhaustion, and, <i>a
fortiori</i>, of self-pollution, do not enter into
this class; and the prognostic which is to
be made of them, when they shall have arrived
at a certain degree, has nothing in it
but what is desperately terrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span> has, in such case, denounced
<span class="smcap">Death</span>. “<i>It is a deplorable disorder</i>,
says <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>; <i>I have often seen it,
but could never cure it.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Van Swieten</span> had, for three years, a
patient whom he mentions for it, under his
hands, without success. I have seen some
perish miserably of this disorder. There
were even others of those patients, to whom I
could not so much as give relief. Yet these
examples should not intirely discourage:
there are not wanting instances of a happier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
issue. Some may be found in the collection
of the <i>Onania</i>, and in the Observations of
Physicians; my own practice has furnished
me some. In the same place where <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>
gives a description of this disease,
he points out means of cure.</p>

<p>“When, (says he,) the patient is in this
condition, let there be fomentations made
for him, over his whole body; then give
him a medicine that may provoke a puke;
after that, another to purge his head, and
then a cathartic by stool. After the purgatives,
give whey or asses milk; after that,
cows milk for forty days. While he drinks
milk, he must abstain from flesh meats,
and in the evening he may have some
boiled wheat. After his milk diet is over,
he should be nourished with the most tender
meats, beginning with a small quantity,
and by this means he will recover
afresh. For a whole twelvemonth he
must avoid all kind of debauchery, all venereal
indulgence, and all immoderate exercise;
he must confine himself to walks,
in which he will do well to avoid the
cold, or the sun.”</p>

<p>It is remarkable here, that <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>
begins the method of cure by an emetic,
and by purging. Now there is a danger
of such an authority’s obtaining the force of
a law, and yet the observation of this law
would, in a number of cases, be pernicious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
But it is easy to get rid of this perplexity,
by observing, that he only ordered purgatives
in a view to divert the fluxion which he
supposed threw itself from the head on the
spine of the back; and that, in another place,
he puts those who are sick, after venereal
excesses, in the catalogue of those to whom
no purgatives should be given, “<i>because not
only they can do no good, but, on the contrary,
they may do a great deal of harm</i><a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.”
So that it is this last rule which must be
considered as the general one: the first constitutes
an exception, and an exception which
appears founded on a theory, of which the
error is now discovered, and which especially
therefore ought to have no force.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span>’s dissertation, which I have
already often quoted, there are to be found
two observations, that should recommend
great circumspection as to the use of emetics.
They are as follow:</p>

<p>A man of fifty years of age, having, for a
long time, indulged himself in excesses with
women, fell into a state of languor, emaciation,
and consumptiveness. His sight
grew dim, so that at length objects appeared
to him as if he saw them through a cloud.
It was at this epoch that he took an emetic
by way of preventing a fever, which he apprehended,
after a long use of eating ham.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
This medicine made his head swell, and totally
deprived him of his eye-sight.</p>

<p>A common prostitute, who, every time
that she had commerce with a man, felt a
dimness in her eyes come upon her, having
taken an emetic, lost her eye-sight intirely<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> seems to have rather
meant to establish the difficulties of the
cure, than to point out the means of obtaining
it.</p>

<p>“There are (says he) little hopes of cure;
the milk passes too easily; the exercise of
riding does no good to this kind of patients;
they complain that these remedies
weaken them; and, in fact, exercise encreases
the waste of their seed, in the
course of their nocturnal pollutions by
dreams, and at the same time diminishes
their strength. When the day re-appears,
they quit their beds, all bathed in their
own sweat, and but the weaker for even
their sleep; they cannot bear aromatics,
of which the effects are also dangerous.
The only resource, in these cases, is that
of aliments, a moderate exercise of the
body, bathing the feet, and frictions
used with precaution<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.”</p>

<p>Among the consultations of this great
man, which M. <span class="smcap">de Haller</span> has added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the edition which he has procured to us of
them, there is one for a man, who had
rendered himself totally impotent for the
joys of love.</p>

<p>“A man (as the case is stated) has so
much weakened the organs of generation,
that the seed comes away of itself, every
time that he has any beginning of erection,
for that is never a complete one<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>,
and the seed never spurts forth with any
force, but dribbles away, drop by drop,
which renders him impotent; his memory,
stomach, loins, legs, are totally weakened.”</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> answered: “These disorders
are always extremely hard to cure:
they hardly ever declare themselves, but
when the body has lost so much of its vital
forces, that the remedies remain without
efficacy. However, it may not be
amiss to try what the following ones will
produce.</p>

<p>“<i>First</i>, A dry and temperate regimen,
composed of fowls, of beef, of mutton,
of kid, all rather roasted than boiled, a
small quantity of ale, but excellent in its
kind, of a very little wine, but then that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
wine must be of a very generous restorative
sort.</p>

<p>“<i>Secondly</i>, A great deal of exercise, augmented,
by due degrees; it should only
border upon weariness, and always be taken
fasting.</p>

<p>“<i>Thirdly</i>, Frictions, with a flannel perfumed
with the smoke of incense, to be
used to the loins, the abdominal region,
the <i>pubis</i>, the groin, the scrotum, and regularly
repeated night and morning.</p>

<p>“<i>Fourthly</i>, He should take, every two
hours, half a drachm of the following
kind of electuary:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“℞. <i>Terr. Japon. dr.</i> iv. <i>Opoponac. dr.</i> v.
<i>Cort. Peruv. dr.</i> vi. <i>Conserv. rosar.
rub. unc.</i> i. <i>Olib. dr.</i> ii. <i>Succ. acac.
unc.</i> ß. <i>Sir. Kerm. q. s. f. l. a.
cond.</i></p>

</div>

<p>“Immediately after which he should drink
half an ounce of the following medicinal
wine:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“℞. <i>Rad. cariophil. mont. Pœn. mar. ana
unc.</i> i. <i>Cort. rad. capp. tamarisc. ana
unc.</i> iß. <i>Lign. agalloch. ver. unc.</i> i.
<i>Vin. Gall. alb. lib.</i> vi. <i>f. l. a. vin.
med.</i></p>

</div>

<p>“I hope (added <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>) that the patient
will be cured, after having employed
this regimen for two months.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>But he would not make use of it, and
died, in a few weeks, of a malignant flux.
What would have been the effect of this
remedy? That can be only conjectured.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Zimmermann</span> wrote to me, that he
had made a patient try it for two months,
but without any success.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> sets forth the precautions
which he conceived ought to be taken, and
the methods to be employed.</p>

<p>“We must (says he) avoid all the remedies
which do not agree with weak habits
of body, or that may weaken still more
those who are already enervated: such are
all astringents, all over-refrigerants, all
saturnines, nitrous, acid, and especially
narcotic medicines: all these are pernicious
in cases of this kind, and unfortunately
there is, however, too much use
made of them.</p>

<p>“The end to be proposed is to re-establish
the vital forces, and to restore to the
fibres the tension they have lost. Heating
remedies, volatiles, aromatics, those that
have an agreeable but strong odor, are not
proper here: nothing but the mildest aliments
should be allowed, such as are the
fittest to repair that nutritious gelatinous
substance, which immoderate evacuations
will have destroyed: such are strong broths
of beef, of veal, of capon, with a little of
wine, of lemon-juice, of salt, of nutmeg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and cloves. To the use of this diet may
beneficially be joined, those remedies
which favor perspiration, and which reanimate
the languishing tone of the fibres.”</p>

<p>In another consultation for a self-pollutor,
he ordered the taking, every morning, a
certain measure of asses milk mixed with a
third of the quantity of <i>Selter-water</i>.</p>

<p>It would be useless here to quote the precepts,
or observations of other authors. I
shall content myself with relating here a very
instructive case, such as it stands in a thesis
of M. <span class="smcap">Wespremi</span>, which thesis includes fourteen
observations, all interesting ones<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">W. Conybeare</span>, about thirty-six years
old, had had, for six years past, his eyes
so dimmed, without any apparent blemish
in them, that he saw all objects as it were
through a thick cloud. He had been successively
in the three most celebrated hospitals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
in London, St. Thomas’s, St. Bartholomew’s,
and St. George’s; at length,
about two years ago, he came to ours.
In all the others, after other remedies, it
had been tried whether a mercurial salivation
might not cure this kind of <i>gutta
serena</i>. The physicians were tired out,
and the patient quite discouraged. On my
interrogating him very particularly, and
very carefully, upon his illness, he told
me, that, from time to time, he felt a
pain all along the spine of his back, especially
when he stooped to take up any
thing; that his legs were so weak, that
he could scarce stand a minute upright,
without leaning, which if he did not, his
legs would tremble, and he had then a
vertigo and dizziness; that his memory
was so weakened, that he sometimes appeared
stupid; and I could myself observe,
that he was greatly emaciated. All this
made me suspect, that his <i>gutta serena</i>
might be no other than the symptom of
a more dreadful disorder, and that the
patient was attacked with a real <i>tabes
dorsalis</i>.</p>

<p>“I pathetically urged him to own to me,
whether he had not polluted himself with
the abominable crime of <span class="smcap">Onan</span>, which
intirely destroys the balsamic parts of the
nervous fluid. After much hesitation, and
blushing, he confessed it. I ordered him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to take, over night, two mercurial pills,
containing six grains each, of <i>mercurius
dulcis</i>, and the next day an ounce of purgative
salts, and to repeat that four times
in the space of fifteen days. On the expiration
of that term, I made him, according
to the prescription of <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>,
live forty days intirely upon a milk-diet,
during which time he used to have himself,
two or three times a week, rubbed,
as he went to bed. At the end of this
method of treatment, he returned from
the country, in a much better condition
than he had gone thither. I advised him,
afterwards the cold-bath for three weeks.
For two months together he took, twice
a day, the mineral electuary and volatile
julep, to which he joined frictions, and
the bathing his feet. These remedies so
far restored his health, that he wanted to
resume the exercise of his trade, which was
that of a baker; but I advised him to betake
himself to some other business, being
afraid that his inhaling the flower, that
rises in the kneading, might form in
his as yet weak stomach and breast, a
paste, of which the effects might be dangerous.”</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Stehelin</span> gave some relief to the
youth mentioned towards the end of the second
Section, by strengthening baths, by <i>Tinct.
Mart. Ludovic.</i> and by aperitive broths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal remedies mentioned in the
<i>Onania</i> consist of nostrums, which the author
reserved to himself. It may be observed
on it, in general, and the observation is important,
that he employed no <i>evacuants</i>,
and that only corroboratives constituted the
basis of them, under the names of <i>The
strengthening tincture</i>, and <i>The prolific powder</i>.
They act, without that action’s producing
any sensible effect, but, as the author
says, they inrich, strengthen, and nourish
the parts of generation in both sexes. According
then to him, they give them new
vigor; they favor the generation of seed,
and powerfully restore oppressed nature: in
a word, like all nostrums, they do every
thing that is required of them. There is a
third secret remedy mentioned, under the
name of <i>The restorative draught</i>, which operates
very efficaciously, and, in fact, if any
faith may be given to the testimonies adduced
in favor of these remedies, they have
doubtless great virtue. Besides these three
nostrums, he gives some formularies: One
is a draught, composed of amber, aromatics,
and of some other remedies of that class:
A second is a liniment, composed of essential
oils, of balsams, of acrid tinctures. Both,
these compositions appear to me too stimulative,
and as they have not any experience
in their favor, I omit the particularising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
them. He specifies two others, which seem
more proper.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Before I go on to the next Section, I think
myself bound to mention, that very sensible
views, applicable to the disease of which I
am treating, may be found in a book lately
published, intitled, <i>Precis de Medecine pratique</i>,
a work of M. <span class="smcap">Lieutaud</span>, physician
to the young royal family of France, who,
after having got to himself a distinguished
name among the Anatomists and Physiologists,
has moreover secured to himself one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of the first ranks among the practitioners,
by his excellent treatise on intermittent and
remittent fevers.</p>

<p>The chapters of his last work relative to
the <i>tabes dorsalis</i>, are those which have for
their title <i>calor morbosus</i>, morbific heat, at
disease, be it here parenthetically remarked,
very frequent, of which no one had before
treated, and which has been often subjected
to improper methods of cure, as I have elsewhere
lamented, and of which M. <span class="smcap">Lieutaud</span>
has been the first to unfold the symptoms,
the nature, and curative indication.
<i>Vires exhaustæ</i>, and <i>anæmia, or deficiency of
blood</i>, a very interesting chapter, which is
intirely and originally that author’s.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span>, whose work I could not procure
for myself before the impression of the
first edition of mine, is one who has the
most of any enlarged upon the method of
cure. I had the pleasure of finding that we
agreed perfectly in our ideas, and that we
employed the same remedies, especially the
bark, and the cold bath; a conformity which
appears to me a proof in favor of the practice
we have, in this case, both followed.
I shall only quote here the two aphorisms
that comprehend the substance of his doctrine:
I shall avail myself of some passages
in the explanation which he gives to them,
to confirm, in the following Section, my own
practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“The cure of this disease (says that able
physician) depends as much on knowing
what to avoid as what to do. Without a
nice regularity of the non-naturals, therefore,
medicine will have little or no effect.
Thus the salubrity of the air is or
great importance; the diet should be analeptic
and cooling; sleep little, and in
due season; moderate exercise must be
used, especially riding on horseback. The
secretions of the body are to be regulated
if out of order, and the patient should be
entertained with chearful company and
mirthful diversions. All the remedies that
are necessary, are derived from the two
classes of balsamics and astringents<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.”</p>

<p>He recommends strongly, in the place of
tea, which, he observes, is always prejudicial
to the nerves, the infusion of mint, or
balm, in every dish of which is to be put a
tea-spoonful of the balsamic mixture of
cream and yolks of eggs beat together, with
two or three drops of oil of cinnamon, which
he says give a very agreeable flavor, and is
highly grateful to the stomach<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. This
indeed I have had occasion to remark myself,
of its being both balsamic and strengthening;
but I shall place here a remark that
may have its use: It is, that M. <span class="smcap">Lewis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></span>
specifies among the corroboratives, medicines
from lead, <i>Tinct. faturnia</i><a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>; and I think
it my duty to give this caution, without offence
to his authority and to that of other
respectable physicians, that the internal use
of all preparations of lead is a real poison,
according to the almost unanimous confession
of all the faculty. I have seen the most
tragical effects from it; and the shameless
rashness of quacks, furnishes but too many
occasions of observing such. But if the use
of it is to be preserved, like that of some
other poisons, let the administration of it at
least be reserved for those who are able to
discern its dangers and its virtues, and not
indicated without due precaution in works
designed for the public.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this Section with the method
employed by M. <span class="smcap">Storck</span> in the cure
of these disorders: it is a very simple and a
very efficacious one. And by comparing
all these methods, it will be seen, that they
are all founded on the same principles, all
tend to the same end, and all employ means
nearly similar, a conformity which forms a
recommendation of the method, and inspires
confidence.</p>

<p>“I begin (says M. <span class="smcap">Storck</span>) by trying
to restore the patient with nourishing
broths. Rice, oatmeal, barley boiled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
broth, or milk, or milk itself, are all very
serviceable; but it must be observed, to let
him eat but little at a time, and often.
Should the stomach be so weakened,
which is sometimes the case when the
disorder is far advanced, that it cannot
bear even these light aliments without
great anguish, the patient should be put
to the female breast of milk, a recourse
which has retrieved many out of the most
desperate condition. To restore strength
and activity to the relaxed fibres, I would
recommend the use of wine heated with
a hot iron, bark, and cinnamon. As soon
as the patient has strength enough to
walk, it will be of infinite service to him,
his going into the purest air of the country,
or mountains<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.”</p>

<h3>SECTION X.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The <span class="smcap">Author</span>’s <span class="smcap">Practice</span>.</i></span></h3>

<p>There are some diseases of which it
is difficult to discover exactly the cause,
and consequently it must be so to determine
the indication, and to regulate the method
of cure; and yet such diseases are easily cured
when those points are once ascertained.
It is not so of the <i>Tabes dorsalis</i>. That disease
is known, its cause is known: (it is, as
M. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span> observes, a particular sort of consumption,
<i>of which the proximate cause is a
general debility of the nerves</i>:) the indication
is easily formed, and there can be no
great differing in opinions about the essential
method of cure: and yet even the best
methods often fail; this is a reason the more
for fixing the particulars with exactness.</p>

<p>A general relaxation of the fibres, a
weakness of the nervous system, a depravation
of the fluids, are the causes of this evil.
It depends on the weakening of all the
parts; the great requisite is to restore strength
to them; this is the sole indication, which
has again its respective subdivisions, derived
from the different parts that are weakened;
but as the same remedies are of service in
them all, it is needless to particularise those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
subdivisions here, which has been already
done in the course of this work.</p>

<p>Those who are totally ignorant of physic,
and who nevertheless talk more of it than
those who understand it, will probably think
it very easy to accomplish this indication;
and that with good aliments, and the cordials
with which pharmacy abounds, it is a
matter of great facility to restore strength;
while, on the contrary, sad experiences have
taught our greatest physicians that nothing
could be more difficult.</p>

<p>“<i>It is easy</i> (says M. <span class="smcap">Gorter</span>) <i>to diminish
the vital forces, but we have hardly
any thing capable to repair them</i><a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.”
This may easily be conceived, on reflecting,
that aliments and remedies are nothing but
the instruments of which Nature makes use
to support itself, to repair her losses, and to
remedy the disorders which happen to the
body. And what is Nature? <i>The aggregate
of the forces of the body harmoniously distributed.</i>
It is the vital force respectively distributed
into the different parts. When
those forces are exhausted, Nature it is that
consequently fails; she is the working architect
that no longer executes her functions;
furnish her with materials, as long as you
please, she is in no condition to employ them.
You may bury an architect, with all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
building, under stone, wood, and mortar,
without an inch of a wall being thereby repaired.
Just so it is with diseases dependent
on the destruction of the vital forces: the
aliments repair nothing, the remedies operate
nothing. I have seen stomachs so weakened,
that aliments received from it no more
preparation than in a vessel of wood: sometimes
they take place in it according to the
laws of their specific gravities, and when,
at length, a new ingestion has, by its
weight, irritated the stomach, they have
been known, on a slight effort, to come
away, successively, clearly separate one from
another. At other times, through a long
stay in the stomach, they corrupt in it, and
are vomited up just as if they had been
suffered to putrify in a vessel of silver or
porcelain. What good can be hoped from
aliments of this sort? The exhaustion of
strength is not, indeed, so considerable in all:
there are some in whom the vital forces are
only weakened without being totally destroyed;
for these there remains some resource in
aliments, and even in remedies. What
remains unperished of Nature draws some
benefit from aliments: as to the remedies,
they are to be sought for among those which
have been observed to be fittest for re-animating
that principle of the vital action
which is verging to extinction: these are the
adventitious aids, with which the architect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
is to be enabled to work at his task at the
least expence possible of the strength that is
left him: sometimes, too, they serve, as a
spur to a weak horse, that may oblige him
to make an effort to get out of a plunge in a
slough; but what expertness, what prudence
are not required, to be able at one cast of
the eye, to judge comparatively the depth of
the slough, and the strength of the animal?
If the attempt is beyond his strength, that
spur will, it is true, oblige him to make an
effort; but if that effort is not sufficient to
disengage him, and bring him into the good
road again, it will only serve to totally exhaust
him.</p>

<p>The weakness which is produced by self-pollution,
is attended with such a difficulty
in the choice of restorative remedies, as
does not occur in other cases; which is,
that those articles must, with the greatest care,
be avoided, that, bringing with them any
irritation, might awaken the sensual passion.
In the animal mechanism, that mechanism
so different from the inanimate, and so
little subjected to the same rules, there is a
law, that, when the motions augment, the
augmentation is the most considerable in the
parts the most susceptible. In self-polluters
those parts are the generative ones. It is in
these parts that the effect of the irritating
remedies will the most sensibly manifest
itself; and the dangerous consequences of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
this effect cannot be too circumstantially
guarded against in the choice of the means
of cure. What then are they to be? This is
what I shall examine, after having particularised
the regimen. In this particularisation, I
shall follow the common division of the six
non-naturals, as they are termed, Air, Aliments,
Rest, Motion, the natural Evacuations,
and the Passions.</p>

<h4><i>AIR.</i></h4>

<p>Air has the influence over us, that
water has over fish, and even a much
more considerable one. Those who know
how great a power the air has, and who
also know that there have been Epicures who
could, by the taste, discover not only the
river, but even the part of the river out of
which the fish had been taken;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse"><i>Ostia sub Tusci?</i></div>
<div class="attr"><span class="smcap">Hor.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">such, I say, will easily be sensible of the
importance it is of to the sick, their breathing
one air preferable to another. Such as
may have once entered into a room inhabited
without being aired; such as may have
kept walking on the side of a marsh in the
heats; or have resided in low places, surrounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
on all sides, with eminences; such
as have made a transition from a populous
town to the country; who have breathed the
air at sun-rise or at mid-day, before or after
a shower of rain; all these, I say, will conceive
how great an influence the air has
over health.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Temperie cœli corpusque, animusque juvatur.</i></div>
<div class="attr"><span class="smcap">Ovid.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The sick or weakly have, more than others,
need of a good air; it is a remedy that acts,
and perhaps the only one that does so, without
the concurrence of our nature’s vital
forces, to which it gives no trouble, and is
no draught upon them: and for that very
reason, it is of the greatest importance not
to neglect it. That air which is the properest
for a general atony or relaxation, is a
dry, temperate air: too moist, or too hot
an air are pernicious. I know one labouring
under a disorder of this kind, whom great
heats throw into a total faintness or exhaustion
of strength, and whose state of
health varies in summer, according to the
vicissitudes of days less hot or less cold. A
cold air is much less to be dreaded; and it
is necessarily, and according to Nature, that
it should be so. Heat relaxes still more the
fibres which are already but too relaxed,
and dissolves still more the humors already
too much dissolved: Cold, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
is a remedy against these two evils. When
the Caribes are attacked with the palsy,
after, and in consequence of those dreadful
convulsions of the cholic, to which they are
subject, when they cannot be sent to the
warm-baths in the north of Jamaica, the
other expedient is to send them to some
place of a colder air than that of their country;
and this bare change of air has always
manifestly a favorable effect.</p>

<p>Another essential quality of the air, is,
that it should not be impregnated with
noxious particles: that it should not have
lost, by its stay or stagnation in inhabited
places, that kind of reviving quality which
constitutes all its efficacy, and which might
be called its vital spirit as necessary to plants
as to animals; and such is the air one
breathes in a country, open, airy, interspersed
with the verdure of herbs, bushes,
and trees.</p>

<p>“Let the sick, says <span class="smcap">Aretæus</span><a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>, live
near meadows, fountains, rivulets; the
freshness they exhale, and the gaiety
which those objects inspire, fortify the
mind, restore strength to the body, and
give new life.”</p>

<p>The air of the town, continually sucked
in and let out again, continually crouded
with foul vapors or infected exhalations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
combines at once the two inconveniences of
possessing less of that vital spirit, and of being
big with noxious particles.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the air of the
country is enriched with the two opposite
qualities. It is a pure virgin air, an air
impregnated with all that is the most volatile,
the most agreeable, the most cordial,
in the effluvia of the plants, and in the
vapor of the earth, which is itself very salubrious.</p>

<p>But it would be of no use to fix on a place
with a good air to live in, if one does not
chuse to breathe it. The air of rooms, or
chambers, if it is not continually renewed,
is nearly the same in all. It can hardly be
called a change of air, from a close room in
town to a close room in the country. There
is no enjoying the benefits of a healthy atmosphere
but in the open fields. If infirmities,
or weakness, hinder the procurement
of that benefit, by the going or the being
carried thither, at least the air of the room,
or chamber, should be renewed several times
in a day; not simply by opening a door or
a window, which renews it only a little, but
in letting into the chamber a torrent of fresh
air, by opening, all at once, two or three
different and opposite inlets. There is no
disorder that does not require this precaution;
but it is requisite not to expose the
sick person to the force of the current of air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and it is always very easy to place him out of
the power of it.</p>

<p>It is also extremely important to breathe
the morning air. Those who deprive themselves
of it, for the sake of remaining in a
stifling atmosphere between four curtains,
voluntarily renounce the most agreeable, and
perhaps the most strengthening of all remedies.
The freshness of the night will, by
morning, have restored to the air all its vivifying
principle; and the dew which evaporates,
by degrees, after having loaded itself
with all the balm of the flowers on
which it will have dwelt, renders the air
truly medicinal; you solace yourself in a vaporous
bath of the essence of plants, the air
of which you continually draw in, and of
which nothing can be equivalently substituted
to the good effect. The ease, the refreshment,
the strength, the appetite, which
we may feel procured by it, for the rest of
the day, are a proof in every one’s power,
and a stronger one than all that I could add.</p>

<p>I have, very recently, seen the most sensible
effects of it on some valetudinarians,
and especially on such as were hypochondriacs:
these experienced, in the clearest
manner, that if they indulged themselves in
breathing the morning air, they were always
the more chearful, the more lively,
for the rest of the day; and those who passed
that rest of the day with them, could not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
by that mark, be mistaken as to the hour
of their rising.</p>

<p>It is easy then to conceive, how important
this effect is for those who are affected, in
any degree, with the <i>Tabes dorsalis</i>, who
are so often hypochondriacal; and in whom
a return of chearfulness is alone sufficient to
furnish an unquestionable sign of a general
amendment of health.</p>

<h4><i>ALIMENTS.</i></h4>

<p>In the choice of Aliments I would recommend
the two following rules:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, To take no aliments, but what,
under a small volume, contain a great deal
of nourishment, and are of easy digestion.
This is an aphorism of <span class="smcap">Sanctorius</span>: <i>Coïtus
immoderatus postulat cibos paucos et boni
nutrimenti</i><a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, To avoid all that have any
acridity.</p>

<p>It is of great importance to restore to the
stomach all its strength; and nothing is
more destructive of the forces of the animal
fibres than an over-stretch; so that the dilatation
of the stomach by an over-abundance
of aliments would daily weaken it:
besides, if it is too full, weak persons feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
a state of uneasiness, of anguish, of debility,
and melancholy, that augments all their disorders.
Both these inconveniences are prevented
by the choice of aliments, such as I
have recommended, by taking of them a
little at a time, and frequently. It is essential
that they should afford an easy nutrition:
the stomach is in no condition with persons
in their state, to conquer any thing hard of
digestion: its action, which is extremely
faint and languid, would be totally destroyed
by aliments too indigest, or of a nature to
diminish its strength.</p>

<p>Upon these principles may be formed a
catalogue of such as are proper in this case,
and of those which should be excluded. In
this last class are all flesh-meats naturally
hard and indigestible; such as pork; all
flesh of old animals; all that has been hardened
by salt or smoak, a preparation which,
at the same time, renders them acrid: all
that are too fat, or greasy; a quality which,
in any other subject of aliment whatever,
relaxes the fibres of the stomach, diminishes
the action, already too weak, of the digestive
juices; they remain indigested, dispose
to obstructions, and acquire, by their
stay in the stomach, an acridity, which,
breeding a continual irritation, gives inquietude,
pains, want of rest, anguish,
feverishness. In short, there is nothing
which persons of a weak digestion ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
more carefully to avoid, than fat or greasy
food. Unfermented pastry-ware, especially
when kneaded up with fat, is another sort
of aliment much above the strength of a
weak stomach. Flatulent garden-stuff is also
very noxious, by producing a turgescence
that distends it, and at the same time cramps
the circulation in the neighbouring parts;
such, in general, are all forts of cabbage, of
leguminous pulse, and such plants as have
a taste and smell remarkably acrid, which
last quality renders them noxious, independently
of their flatulency.</p>

<p>Fruits, which are so salutary in acute and
inflammatory distempers, in obstructions,
especially those of the liver, and in several
other disorders, are never proper in this
case; they weaken, relax, and enervate the
strength of the stomach; they augment the
attenuation of the blood, already too aqueous;
and ill digested, they ferment in the
stomach and intestines, and this fermentation
sets free an astonishing quantity of air,
which produces enormous distensions, that
absolutely disturb the course of the circulation.
I have, in a woman, seen this effect:
so considerable, for her having eaten too
many cherries and currants, four and twenty
hours after a very easy delivery, that her
belly was stretched to such a degree as to
become livid; she appeared lethargically
dozing, and her pulse was almost imperceptible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Fruits also leave, in the first passages,
a principle of acidity, apt to occasion several
dangerous symptoms, so that it is necessary
to abstain almost totally from them. Crude
garden-stuff, vinegar, verjuice, have the like
inconveniences, and deserve the like exclusion.</p>

<p>But though the catalogue of prohibited
articles of food be a long one, that of the
allowable ones is still longer. It comprehends
the flesh of all young animals, fed in
healthy places, and wholesomely fed; such
especially is that of veal, lamb, or young
mutton, young beef, fowl, pigeon, turkey,
partridge. Lark, thrushes, quails, and other
wild fowl, without being absolutely forbidden,
are, however, attended with such
inconveniences, as not to allow of their entering
into daily food. Fish is under the
same restriction.</p>

<p>But it is not enough only to chuse your
flesh-meats with due discernment, but they
must also be properly prepared. The best
way is to roast them by a gentle fire, so as to
preserve their gravy, and not dry them up
too much; or to stew them slowly in their
own juices. The flesh-meats that are boiled
in too much water, give out to it all that
they have of juiciness, and remain incapable
of nourishing: thus they often become nothing
but fleshy fibres deprived of their
nutritious juice, and equally insipid to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
taste, and indigestible to the stomach. It is
common for weak persons, and even for
such of them as are above all suspicions of
being too nice, not to be able to eat of them
without their stomach being disordered by
them. The more tender flesh meats are, the
less they can bear this preparation, which,
in the case of sick people, ought to be
reserved for extracting by it from hard or
tough meats whatever nourishment they
may contain.</p>

<p>Yet whatever preparation may be carefully
employed upon the flesh meats, there
are persons who cannot digest them: and
to them it becomes as necessary to give
them the broth, extracted by a gentle boiling;
but as that has too great a tendency to
putrefaction, it must be accompanied with
some bread, and a dash of lemon juice, or a
little wine: such a mixture is of the most
desirable, in that case, for nourishment.
Some lobsters boiled, and crushed in the
broth, heighten its relish, and make it perhaps
more strengthening; but they have the
double inconvenience, of being somewhat
heating, and of rendering the broth more
susceptible of a quick corruption; so that on
these two accounts it is good to be on one’s
guard.</p>

<p>Bread and garden-stuff have not the advantage
of containing at once a great deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
nourishment in a small quantity; but the
use of them, especially of bread, is indispensably
necessary, to prevent, not only the
distaste which the use of a regimen consisting
totally of animal meats would not fail of
producing, but also that putridity which
would be the consequence of them, if not
mixed with vegetables. Without this precaution,
there would soon a spontaneous
alkali disclose itself in the first passages,
with all the disorders consequential thereto.
I have seen terrible accidents produced by
this regimen, in weak persons, to whom it
had been prescribed. One of the commonest
symptoms is, thirst; they are obliged
to drink, and drink weakens them: besides,
the liquid they drink does not easily mix
with the humors of the body, as that mixture
depends on the action of the vessels,
which is very languid; and if, unfortunately,
as is not unfrequent with those who do not
use much motion, the action of the kidneys
diminishes, the liquids pass into the cellular
membrane, and immediately form œdematous
swellings there, and, at length, dropsies
of all kinds.</p>

<p>These dangers are prevented by a due
alliance of the vegetable regimen with the
animal. The best garden-ware are, the
tender roots, herbs of the endive kind, artichoaks,
asparagus. There are some others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
which, though tender, are of disservice;
being too cooling, they deaden the strength
of the stomach.</p>

<p>Farinaceous grains, prepared and boiled
in cream, with flesh broth, are an aliment
not to be slighted, as it combines every
thing that is nourishing in the two kingdoms
animal and vegetable, while their mixture
prevents the danger from each aliment
given single; the broth hinders the meal
from turning sour, the meat the broth from
putrefying. By reading, with a little reflexion,
observant Naturalists, it may easily
be perceived, that distempers are more malignant
in the north of Europe than in its
middle regions: may not that be owing to
more flesh meats being eaten in proportion
than vegetables?</p>

<p>What I have above said of fruits, need
not, however, hinder, where the stomach
still preserves something of its strength, one’s
indulging one’s self, now and then, with a
small quantity of the best chosen for the
sort, and for ripeness; the most watery
are those which are the least proper.</p>

<p>Eggs are an aliment of the animal kind,
and an aliment extremely useful; they
strengthen greatly, and are easy of digestion,
provided that they have but little or even no
preparation by fire, for if the white is once
hardened it does not dissolve again; it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
heavy, indigest, and unnutritious: it
might then be the aliment of those who
digest too quickly, and not of those who
have rather no digestion. The best way of
eating them, is just as they are new laid
from the fowl, without any preparation, or
in the shell, after only three or four dips in
boiling water, or stirred into warm, and not
boiling broth.</p>

<p>Conclusively; there remains to mention
the aliment from milk; which unites all
the qualities that can be desired, without
having any of the inconveniences that are to
be dreaded. It is the most simple, the
most easily assimilable, and the quickest
restorative: all prepared as it is by nature,
it needs no risk of spoiling it by an artificial
preparation: like the broth of flesh meats
it nourishes, but is not susceptible of putridity;
it prevents thirst, it supplies the place
of meat and drink; it keeps up all the secretions;
it disposes for tranquil sleep; in short,
it fulfils all the indications that present themselves
in this case. M. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span> attests its
having produced the best effects<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. Why
then is not it always employed, always substituted
to the other aliments? Answer.
For a reason which is peculiar to it, which
unnaturalises its effect, and which makes it
sometimes produce a very different one, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that which might be hoped from it, or reasonably
expected.</p>

<p>This reason is, that sort of decomposition
to which it is subject. If the digestion
of it is not very quick, if it stays too long
in the stomach, or if, without too long a
stay there, it meets in it with matters of a
nature to hasten that decomposition, it undergoes
in the stomach all the changes,
which fall under our observation, out of it.
The butyrous, the caseous, the serous parts
separate; the whey sometimes occasions a
quick diarrhœa; sometimes it passes off by
the urinary passages, or by perspiration without
nourishing; the other parts, if they stay
in the stomach, are not long before they
trouble it, cause uneasy sensations, bloatedness,
loathings, cholics; and if one is not
immediately affected by them, it is because
they will have passed into the intestines,
where they may, it is true, remain some
time without a sensible prejudice, but they
acquire there a singular acridity, and after
a certain time they produce mischiefs which
the delay will not have rendered the less
dangerous; and, indeed, it may be established
for a law, that should render one
extremely circumspect in the prescription of
it in dangerous cases, that if it is an aliment
of which the digestion is the easiest, it is
also that of which the indigestion is the
most noxious. We have already mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the difficulties that <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> found in
the use of it; but however great they may be,
the advantages to be drawn from it are so
considerable, that it is worth while to study
all possible means for surmounting them, and
happily such means there are. They may
be ranged under two classes; attentions to
the regimen, and the medicines. Of these
last I shall refer the discussion to one of the
following articles.</p>

<p>The attentions to the regimen are, first,
the choice of the milk. From whatever
species it may be determined to procure it,
the female that furnishes it should be healthy,
and live regular: Secondly, during the
time of taking it, all aliments should be
avoided that can turn it sour; such are all
fruits, raw or prepared, and in general
every thing that is acid: Thirdly, it must be
taken at times very distant from other aliments;
it not taking kindly any mixture:
Fourthly to take only a little of it at a time:
Fifthly, all the while to take care of keeping
the breast, the abdominal region, and the
legs extremely warm: and, above all, Sixthly,
(for without this precaution all the others
would be useless,) to be very moderate as to
the quantity of even the best chosen aliments.
During this recourse to milk, there
should be no trouble given to the stomach;
the smallest over-load, the slightest indigestion,
leaves in it a principle of corruption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
which presently turns the milk, and may,
of the most wholesome of aliments, make a
poison sometimes very violent, and, at least,
almost always infallibly one, in a greater or
less degree.</p>

<p>Another question occurs: What is the
milk that merits preference? In answer to
this, I will not enter into an examination of
the various sorts of milk; this would be
over-lengthening my work by an adventitious
subject; for satisfaction in which there are
many recourses extant, and perhaps none
better than a dissertation, now indeed out of
print, of the late Mons. d’<span class="smcap">Apples</span>, M. D.
and Professor of Greek and Morality in this
College<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.</p>

<p>Now-a-days there are hardly any kinds
of milk used but of the female breast, or of
asses milk, the goat’s, or the cow’s. Each
has its different qualities: it is the comparison
of these qualities, and of the indication
presented by the disorder, that should
determine the choice from among them.
There are few cases in which milk from the
cow may not be succedaneously used for all
the others. That from the female breast is
generally believed the most strengthening:
it is the notion of the greatest masters in the
art, and yet this opinion bears upon a ruinous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
foundation, which is, the women’s making
use of animal food, without considering
at the same time that the preference is
constantly given to the milk of a hale robust
nurse from the country, who eats no flesh-meats,
or, at least, very little, and who lives
only upon bread and vegetables. I believe,
however, that there are cases in which it
may be tried with success. The noble cures
operated by the use of it, leave no doubt of
its efficacy; but there is one inconvenience
which is peculiar to it, which is, that it
must be taken immediately from the breast
that furnishes it: this is a precaution, of
which <span class="smcap">Galen</span> has already taken notice of
the necessity, and, in ridicule of those who
would not care to confine themselves to it,
he refers them “<i>like asses, to asses milk</i>.”
But in the case of recourse to the female
breast for lactation, might not the vessel of
conveyance excite those desires which the
main point is to keep under? Might it not
expose the patient to the temptation of renewing
the adventure of that Prince, the
story of whom <span class="smcap">Capivaccio</span> has preserved
to us? He had two nurses given him, whose
milk produced so good an effect, that he put
them both into a condition of supplying him,
at the end of some months, with new milk
on a fresh account, if he should happen to
need it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>It is thought that asses milk has the nearest
analogy to that of the female breast; but,
if I may be allowed to say it, this assertion
is rather matter of opinion than of experience.
It is the most serous, and, from that
very quality, the most laxative. It is a most
pernicious error the imagining it the most
strengthening. Daily observations demonstrate
the contrary, and prove not only that
it is not the most efficacious, but that it is,
perhaps, the least so. I have rarely seen
any good effects from it; sometimes I have
seen bad ones, and am not the only one
that has seen them. M. <span class="smcap">de Haller</span>, writing
to me, says, “It appears to me, that
this same asses milk rarely does what it is
desired to do.” Now, the inutility of a
pretended remedy, in disorders where the
hopes of a cure are founded on it, is one of
the most grievous defects. M. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span>
advised it in cases where there were at once
an exhaustion and a desire<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.</p>

<p>Before I quit this subject of Aliments, I
ought to conclude with the counsel of <span class="smcap">Horace</span>,
to avoid mixtures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent9">——<i>nam variæ res</i></div>

<div class="verse"><i>Lenta feret pituita.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To sense it is obvious enough, without
any need to insist on this advice, how impossible
it is for very different aliments to
undergo, within the same time, a perfect
digestion: this mixture it is which is one of
the causes that ruin the healthiest constitutions,
and is mortal to weak ones: it cannot
be too carefully avoided.</p>

<p>Another attention equally necessary, and
almost equally neglected, is, a thorough
mastication. This is a help to digestion,
of which even the most vigorous stomachs
cannot be long deprived, without a notable
decline or diminution; and without which
the digestion in weak ones is extremely imperfect.
Nothing but a long and attentive
observation could satisfy one of the infinite
importance to health of a careful mastication.
I have seen the most stubborn diseases of the
stomach, and the most inveterate languors,
dissipated singly by this attention. On the
other hand, I have seen persons in good
health fall into infirmities, when their
teeth, being damaged, no longer suffered
them to employ any but an imperfect mastication;
nor recovered they their health,
till, after a total loss of their teeth, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
gums acquired such a hardness as to enable
them to supply their function.</p>

<p>So many particulars, so many precautions,
so many self-denying privations, will seem
very fit to verify this line of M. <span class="smcap">Procope</span>,</p>

<p class="noindent">But is there any paying too dear for health?
How amply are you satisfied for the sacrifices
you make, by the enjoyment of it,
and by the pleasures it throws into all the
moments of your life? “Without health
(says <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>) there can be no enjoyment
of any earthly good; honors,
riches, and all other advantages are of no
avail<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.”</p>

<p>Besides, these sacrifices are much less than
it is commonly imagined they are. I could
quote many witnesses, to whom, after just
the first days, it no longer cost them any
pain to renounce the variety and savoriness
of rich viands, for the sake of a simplicity
of regimen: which is what nature points
out, and is the most pleasing to well constituted
organs. A healthy palate, which has
all the sensibility that it ought to have, can
have no relish but for plain meats; made
dishes and high sauces are insupportable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
it, while, in the least savory aliments, it finds
a relish, and a variety of relish, which escape
the depraved, worn out, or furred organs of
taste: so that those who return to the simplicity
of nature in their aliments, whether it
is for their health, or from convinced reason,
or from a contracted distaste to high eating,
may be assured, that so fast as they shall recover
their health, they will find in plain aliments
a delight of the palate which they did
not suspect in them. A fine ear discerns the
slight difference between two notes, which
will have escaped a less sensible ear: just so
it is with the nerves of the organs of taste;
when they are in exquisite order, they perceive
the slightest varieties of savors, and
are sensible to them; the water-drinkers
meet with waters as flattering to their taste
as the most exquisite Falernian could be to
drinkers of wine, and others as disagreeable
to them, as to those the pricked wines of
Brie.</p>

<p>But even were there not rational hopes of
pleasure in the plain regimen, and I am sure
it is not hard to accommodate one’s self to that
which I have indicated, the satisfaction one
must feel, the consideration that, in submitting
to it, one is fulfilling a duty to
one’s self, must be a greatly pressing motive,
as well as a justly flattering reward, for
those who can know all the value of the
being well with one’s self.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The liquid part of aliments, or the drink,
is an article of the regimen almost as important
as the solid, or eating.</p>

<p>All liquids should be forbidden that can
augment the weakness or relaxation, that
can diminish the little that remains of the
digestive powers, that can convey any acridity
into the humors, or dispose the nervous
system, already too irritable, to a greater
mobility. All hot waters have the first
defect, of weakening or relaxing. Tea,
with that, has also all the others: coffee has
the two last; so that one ought rigorously to
abstain from them. The author of a work
superior to all encomiums, and of which
those who interest themselves in the progress
of the medical art, wait with the
greatest impatience for the continuation, has
presented such an account of the danger of
these two liquids, as might very well disgust
or deter from the use of them those who
find the greatest pleasure in them<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.</p>

<p>Spirituous liquors, which, at the first view
might appear serviceable, for that they operate
precisely the contrary of hot water, of
which they really diminish the danger, if
added to it in a small quantity, are, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
attended with other inconveniences
that authorise their rejection, or at least restrain
them to an extremely rare recourse.
Their action is too violent, too transient;
they irritate more than they strengthen, and
if they sometimes strengthen, the weakness
which succeeds is greater than before a recourse
to them: besides, they give to the <i>papillæ</i>
of the stomach a hardness that robs them
of that degree of sensibility necessary to the
creation of an appetite, and take from the
liquids that degree of fluidity which they
ought to have in aid of that sensation; and,
indeed, the great drinkers of spirituous liquors
are strangers to it. “Those (says the
illustrious author whom I have just now
quoted) who every day drink strong liquors
after their meals, by way of remedying the
defects of digestion, could hardly find a
more likely method for accomplishing just
the contrary to what they propose, and to
destroy the powers of digestion.”</p>

<p>The best drink is water from the purest
spring, mixed, equal parts, with a wine
neither too heady nor too acid: the heady
kinds sensibly irritate the nervous system,
and produce in the humors a transient rarefaction,
of which the effect is an extension
of the vessels, that leaves them afterwards
the laxer for it, and to augment the dissolution
of the humors: the acid kinds weaken
the digestions, irritate, and procure over-copious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
urines, which exhaust the patients.
The best are those which have the least of
spirit and of salt, the most of terrestrial and
oily, which constitutes what is called racy,
generous wines: such are the red wines of
Burgundy, of the Rhône, of Neufchâtel,
and a few kinds in this country, (Lausanne,)
the old white wines of Grave, the choice
ones of Pontac, the wines of Spain, Portugal,
the Canaries, and, where procurable,
those of Tockay, superior perhaps to those
of all the world besides, both for salubrity
and deliciousness to the taste. As to common
use there are none preferable to those
of Neufchâtel.</p>

<p>In places where good water is not to be
come at, it may be corrected by filtration,
by a hot iron, or an infusion of some agreeable
aromatics, such as cinnamon, aniseed,
lemon-peel.</p>

<p>Common beer is noxious. Mum which
is properly an extract from grain, both
nourishing and strengthening, may be of
great use: rich of spirit, it enlivens as much
as wine, and is more nutritious; it may
serve for meat and drink.</p>

<p>Among the useful drinks, may be ranked
chocolate, which belongs perhaps more properly
to the class of solid aliments; the cocoa
contains a great deal of nutritious substance,
and the mixture with it of sugar and aromatics
corrects any detriment from its oiliness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
“Chocolate made with milk (says M.
<span class="smcap">Lewis</span>) in such quantities as to pass easy
off the stomach, is an excellent breakfast
for a tabid constitution. I knew a child
twelve years old who was in the last stage
of a consumption, when given over by a
Physician, recovered by the mother’s giving
her chocolate only, in small quantities,
often repeated. Indeed it is an aliment
that for weak constitutions cannot be too
much recommended<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.” Be it, however,
remarked, that there are some to whom it
might prove very pernicious.</p>

<p>One general attention to be observed is,
that too great a quantity of any drink whatever
should be avoided: it weakens the
digestions by relaxing the stomach; by
drowning the digestive juices, and by precipitating
the aliments before they are well
digested; it relaxes all the parts, it dissolves
the humors; it disposes to urines and to
sweats that exhaust the patients. I have seen
disorders produced by an atony, considerably
lessened, by no other means of assistence,
than by a retrenchment of a part of the
liquids for drinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>SLEEP.</i></h4>

<p>What is to be said of sleep, may be
reduced to three points; its duration,
the time of taking it, and the precaution
necessary for a quiet undisturbed enjoyment
of it.</p>

<p>In grown persons seven hours of sleep, or
at the most eight, are sufficient for any one:
there is even a danger in sleeping longer,
and in remaining longer a bed, which throws
one into the same disorders as an excess of
rest. If any could wish to indulge it longer,
it might be those who give themselves a
great deal of motion, and of violent motion,
during the day time; but it is not those who
practise such indulgence; on the contrary, it
is those who lead the most sedentary life.
Thus that term ought never to be exceeded,
unless one should be fallen into such a degree
of weakness as not to have the strength
necessary left for the being long up; in
which case, however, one should try to
keep so as long as possible. “The more
moderate the quantity of his sleep (says
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span>) the sweeter and more invigorating
will it be.”</p>

<p>It stands demonstrated, that the air of the
night is less healthy than that of the day,
and that the weakly sick are more susceptible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of its influences in the evening than the
morning; as then, during our sleep, we are
confined to a small part of the atmosphere,
which our bodies also would not fail of corrupting;
it is to sleep that that time should
be appropriated, in which the air is the
least healthy, and in which the being up in
it would be the most pernicious; so that it
is best to go to bed early, and rise early.
This is a precept so commonly known, that
it may appear trivial to recall it to mind;
but it is actually so much neglected, the consequence
of it seems to be so little felt,
though infinitely greater than it is believed
to be, that it is very allowable to suppose it
unknown, and to re-inculcate it by an insistence
on its importance, especially to valetudinarians.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span> gives it for his opinion,
“That if a patient lies down at ten o’ clock,
which hour he should never exceed, he
ought to rise in the summer-time at four
or five, in the winter at six or seven, under
an absolute prohibition of an indulgence
in bed in the morning.” He recommends
even the forming a habit of getting
up after one’s first sleep, and avers, that
uneasy as this custom might be at the first,
it would soon become easy and agreeable<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.
A number of examples attest the salutariness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of this advice: there are many valetudinarians
who feel themselves light and well on
waking out of their first sleep, and who experience
a laborious restlessness on yielding
to the temptation of going to sleep again:
they are as sure of passing a good day of it,
if, at whatever the hour be of their waking
out of their first sleep they immediately get
up, as of passing it disagreeably, if they give
way to the second.</p>

<p>Sleep is not tranquil but where there are
no causes of irritation: which ought therefore
to be carefully prevented. Three of
the most important attentions are;</p>

<p><i>First</i>, Not to be in a hot air, and to be
neither too much nor too little covered.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Not to have the feet cold at lying
down; an accident common to weak
persons, and which is, for many reasons,
hurtful to them. The rule of <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>
should be scrupulously observed, <i>To
sleep in a cool place, taking care to cover one’s
self</i><a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, And what is yet more important,
not to lie down upon a full stomach:
nothing disturbs more the sleep, nor contributes
more to render it disquieting, painful,
heavy, or overwhelming, than a laborious
digestion in the night. Depression of spirits,
weakness, disgust, weariness, incapacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of thought or of application to any thing
the next day, are the inevitable consequences.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent6">——<i>vides ut pallidus omnis</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Cœna desurgat dubia? Quin corpus onustum,</i></div>

<div class="verse"><i>Atque affligit humo divinæ particulam auræ.</i></div>
<div class="attr"><span class="smcap">Hor.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the contrary, nothing is more efficacious
toward procuring a sweet, calm, uninterrupted,
refreshing sleep, than a light supper.
Freshness, agility, gaiety, are, the ensuing
day, its necessary consequences.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse"><i>Membra dedit, vegetus præscripta ad munia surgit.</i></div>
<div class="attr">Ibid.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The time of sleep (says Mr. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span>,
with great reason) is that of nutrition,
and not of digestion.” Accordingly he
requires of his patients the greatest severity
as to their supper: he prohibits to them,
and never was a juster prohibition, all flesh-meats
at that meal; he allows them nothing
but a little milk, and some bread sippets,
and that two hours before they go to bed
that the first digestion may be over before
they lie down to sleep. The Atlantics, who
were strangers to an animal diet, and who
never ate any thing that had life, were famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
for the tranquillity of their sleep,
and hardly so much as knew what dreams
were.</p>

<h4><i>MOTION.</i></h4>

<p>Exercise is a point of absolute necessity.
To the weak it is a pain to
take it; and if they have any inclination to
melancholy or dejection of spirit, it is not
easy to determine them to motion; and yet
nothing is more apt to augment all the evils
that proceed from weakness, than inactivity;
the fibres of the stomach, of the intestines,
of the vessels, are lax; the humors every
where stagnate, because the solids have no
longer the strength to impress on them the
necessary motion: thence are generated lodgments
of matter, choaked up passages, obstructions,
extravasations; coction, nutrition,
the secretions, do not proceed; the blood
remains aqueous, the strength diminishes,
and all the symptoms of the disorder increase.
Exercise prevents all these evils, by
augmenting the force of the circulation; all
the functions execute themselves as if there
existed in the body a real strength for it,
and this regularity of the functions does not
fail soon to give it, so that the effect of motion
is to supplement the vital forces, and
to restore them. Another of its advantages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
independent of the augmentation of circulation,
is its enabling one to enjoy an air always
new. A person that does not stir,
soon corrupts the air which surrounds him,
and becomes noxious to him: whereas a
person in action is continually changing it.
Motion may often supply the place of remedies,
but all the remedies in the world cannot
supply the place of motion.</p>

<p>The fatigue of the first days of attempting
it, is a rock against which the faint heart
of many of the sick is apt to split; but if
they had the courage to conquer this first
obstacle, they would soon be experimentally
sensible, that to this case especially it is that
that proverbial saying is truly applicable, <i>Il
n’y a que les premiers pas qui coûtent</i>: “It
is only the first steps that are hard to take.”
I have been myself astonished at seeing to
what a degree those who had not been disheartened
at the first, acquired strength by
exercise. I have seen persons fatigued with
one turn in a garden, arrive, in a few weeks,
at being able to take a walk two leagues,
and be the better after it.</p>

<p>The exercise of walking on foot is not
the only favorable one. For persons extremely
weak, for such as have a complaint
of their bowels or breast, riding on horseback
is even better: but in a still greater
weakness, the motion of a carriage, if not
too easy an one, is preferable. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
weather does not allow of going out, some
means of motions should be contrived, in
the house, some not too laborious occupation,
or some exercise of play; such, for
example, as the battledore and shuttle-cock,
which diffuses through the whole body an
equable motion.</p>

<p>A return of appetite, of sleep, of chearfulness,
are the necessary consequences of
motion; but the precaution should be observed,
of not taking any thing of a violent
motion immediately after a meal, and not
to eat while warm from exercise; which
should be taken before a meal, with allowance
of some moments of rest before the sitting
down to it.</p>

<h4><i>EVACUATIONS.</i></h4>

<p>The evacuations are apt to be disordered
along with the other functions,
and their disorder increases that of the whole
machine; it is then of importance to give
attention thereto, in order to the earliest
remedy. The evacuations which principally
require observation are, the stools,
the urines, the perspiration, and the saliva.
The best way to keep them in due order,
or to bring them to the point at which they
ought to be at, is to govern one’s self by
those precepts which I have laid down on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the other objects of regimen: when those
are heedfully attended to in practice, the
evacuations, whose greater or the less regularity
is the barometer of the better or worse
state of digestions, proceed regularly enough.
That evacuation which it is of the most
importance to favor, as being the most considerable,
is perspiration, which very easily
goes out of order, in weak persons. It
may be aided by having the skin very regularly
rubbed with a flesh-brush, or a flannel;
but when it is very languishing indeed,
there is not a surer way to restore it, than
to put the whole body immediately into
woollen covering. And yet care should
be taken to avoid too warm a dress, for
fear of sweating, which is always detrimental
to perspiration; the forced strainers remain
the weaker, and perform their functions
the worse: too cool a dress is also to be
shunned, as that is an enemy equally to all
cutaneous evacuations. The part which
every person, and especially the weak, ought
to keep the warmest, is the feet. This easy
precaution would never be neglected, if the
importance of it to the preservation of the
whole machine was sufficiently known.
Frequent catching cold of the feet disposes
to the most terrible chronical diseases. There
are many on whom it immediately produces
bad effects. But those especially who are
subject to disorders of the breast, to cholics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
or to obstructions, cannot too much guard
against these dangers. Those priests who
used to walk bare-footed on the pavement of
the temples were often attacked with violent
cholics.</p>

<p>The <i>saliva</i> often is an over abundant
secretion in weak persons; which is owing
to a relaxation of the salivary organs. Now
if the patients spit out continually this saliva,
thence result two evils; the one, that they
exhaust themselves by this evacuation; the
other, that this humor, so necessary to the
work of digestion, which without it operates
but imperfectly, fails, and thereby
renders it laborious and defective. I have
already sufficiently explained myself on the
dangers of a bad digestion, not to need here
much insistence on those incident to an evacuation,
on which the digestion so essentially
depends. For this reason it is that Mr.
<span class="smcap">Lewis</span> forbids smoaking to his patients.
Smoaking, among its other inconveniences,
disposes to an abundant salivation, by the irritation
it produces on the glands which furnish
this secretion.</p>

<p>Might not the inhalation from one person
to another, which I have precedently mentioned,
be here recalled to mind as one of
the means of cure? <span class="smcap">Capivaccio</span> had judged
it of use to the person under his care, that
should lie between the two nurses that
suckled him; and it is very probable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the inhalation of their atmosphere contributed
perhaps as much as their milk to
restore his strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elidæus</span>, cotemporary with <span class="smcap">Capivaccio</span>,
and preceptor to <span class="smcap">Forrestus</span>, who has
preserved to us this observation<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, advised
a young man, who was in a <i>marasmus</i>,
to asses milk, and to have his nurse lie in the
same bed with him, who was a woman extremely
healthy, and in the flower of her
age: this advice had the greatest success;
nor was the compliance with it discontinued
till the patient owned he could no longer
resist the inclination grown upon him, to
make an illicit use of the strength that was
returned to him. A remedy, on the foot of
this utility by inhalation might be preserved,
and yet the danger be prevented by not
mixing the sexes.</p>

<h4><i>The PASSIONS.</i></h4>

<p>The intimate union of the soul and
body has been precedently mentioned;
how great the influence is of the well-being
of the first, over the last, cannot have escaped
comprehension; the sinister effects of melancholy
have been pointed out; so that it is
almost needless here to add, that too great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
care cannot be taken to avoid the unpleasant
sensations of the soul, and that it is of the
highest consequence to procure for it none but
the most agreeable ones; indeed in all distempers,
but especially in those, which, like
the <i>tabes dorsalis</i>, of themselves dispose to
sadness, a sadness which, by a vitious circle,
considerably augments those distempers. But
(and this makes one of the difficulties of the
cure) it often happens that the patients take
a kind of pleasure in this symptom of their
disorder, and there is no prevailing on them
to determine upon making any efforts to get
the better of it. Besides, not to deceive
ourselves, we must not imagine that it is
enough to prescribe to a person to be chearful,
for him to be so. Mirth is voluntary.
Laughing is no more to be commanded than
it is to be forbidden. A man can no more help
his being sad, than having a fit of a fever,
or the torture of a tooth-ach. All that can
be required or expected of the patients is,
that they will no more refuse their yielding
to accept or try the remedies prescribed to
them against their melancholy, than they
refuse yielding to other remedies. Now
the remedies are not so much, in this case,
company, (we have already observed that it
was displeasing to them, for particular reasons)
as a variety of situations. A continual change
of objects for a succession of ideas that diverts
them, and this is what they need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing can be more pernicious to persons
inclined to deliver themselves up to one idea,
than inaction, or want of occupation. But,
above all, nothing is worse than that for the
case here treated of: the patients cannot too
much avoid idleness, and the being too much
left or abandoned to themselves. Rural
exercises, or employment, comprehend the
most powerful diversion. <span class="smcap">M. Lewis</span> advises,
“that the sick should, if possible, see
none but those of their own sex;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“<i>Nam non ulla magis vires industria firmat</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Quam Venerem et cæci stimulos avertere amoris.</i></div>
<div class="attr"><span class="smcap">Virg.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“that they should never be absolutely alone;
that they should be kept from giving themselves
up to their own reflexions; that
they should be diverted or kept from reading,
or any occupation of the mind; all
these, (as he observes,) being so many
causes that exhaust the spirits and retard
the cure.” I should not, however, be for
totally debarring them from all reading. It
might be enough to forbid their reading for
too long a time at once, if it were but on
account of the weakness of their eyes; or
all reading that should require too much application,
but especially and severely any
kind of reading that might recall to their
mind ideas, or to their imagination objects,
of which it were to be wished they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
lose the remembrance: but there are subjects
which, without much fixing the attention,
and without recalling dangerous images,
might agreeably divert, entertain, and prevent
the terrible dangers of a wearisome
idleness.</p>

<h4><i>REMEDIES.</i></h4>

<p>I shall follow the same order as in the
preceding article. I shall point out the pretended
remedies, which are to be avoided,
before I enter on the mention of those which
are the eligible ones. I have already taken
notice of a first class of those which should
be excluded, the irritating, the heating, the
volatile medicines. There is a second one, of a
very opposite nature, and equally noxious,
and that is evacuatives. I have already observed,
that sweats, an over-secretion of the
<i>saliva</i>, and too copious urines, exhausted the
patient. I shall not then repeat my premonition
against those evacuations: it is consequentially
clear enough, that all the medicines
which excite them, should be banished.
It remains then to examine the propriety of
bleeding, and of the evacuations of the <i>primæ
viæ</i>. The curative indications being to restore
strength, now, in order to judge whether
they are proper, it is but to know whether
they can be expected to answer that indication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
I shall not be long on this head.
There are two cases in which bleeding restores
strength; in all others, it diminishes
it. The first is, when there is too great an
abundance of blood; this is not the case in
consumptions; or when the blood has acquired
an inflammatory inspissation, which,
rendering it unfit for its uses, quickly destroys
the vital forces; this is the disorder of the
vigorous, of those who have rigid fibres,
and a strong circulation: our sick are in precisely
the contrary case; bleeding then cannot
but be hurtful to them. “Every drop
of blood, (according to M. <span class="smcap">Gilchrist</span>,)
is precious to persons in a consumption:
the assimilating power that repairs it being
destroyed, they have not more than barely
sufficient to keep up the circulation, and
that but a languid one<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.” M. <span class="smcap">Lobb</span>,
who has very justly calculated the effects of
evacuations, is positive in this sense. He
observes, “that in bodies, which have no
more than the necessary quantity of blood,
if that is diminished by bleeding or other
evacuations, the vital forces are at the same
time diminished, the secretions disturbed,
and various disorders produced<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.”</p>

<p>The manner in which M. <span class="smcap">Senac</span> speaks
of bleeding gives it yet more precisely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
exclusion in this case. “If (says he) the
thick or red globules of the blood be deficient,
bleeding is useless or rather pernicious:
it ought then to be forbidden in
extenuated bodies, where the blood is in
small quantity, or not of due consistence, as
when there comes from the vessels but a
liquid that can scarce color linnen or
water<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.” It has been observed, that
such is the state of the blood in those who
have hurt themselves by self-pollution; and
such it is generally in the weak and in valetudinarians.
Let those who attempt the
cure, in this case, by bleeding, compare
that method with this precept founded on
the most enlightened theory, and on numerous
practical observations, well digested by
reflection; these constitute the basis of the
work from which I draw it, and then let
them judge of the success they ought to expect.</p>

<p>Those medicines which evacuate the first
passages, conduce to the restoration of
strength, when, in those parts, there is formed
a lodgment of matters so considerable by
their mass, as to cramp or obstruct the
functions of all the <i>viscera</i>, or when there
are in the stomach, or in the first intestines,
putrid matters, of which the common effect
is a prodigious weakness. In those cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
evacuatives may be prescribed, if nothing
contra-indicates them, if there are no other
means of freeing the first passages, or if there
should be any danger in not evacuating them
quickly enough. These three conditions
have rarely place in persons who are in a
state of consumption, and in whom the
weakness and atony of the first passages is a
counter-indication, ever present, to purgatives
or emetics. There is oftenest another
method of procuring a successive evacuation,
which is, the employing the non-astringent
tonics; such are a great number of bitters,
which, by restoring play to the organs, produce
the double good effect of digesting
what is not indigestible, and of evacuating
the superfluities. In short, there is rarely
any danger in not evacuating them quickly
enough. This danger, indeed, sometimes
exists in acute diseases; the acridity of the
matters which the heat augments, and the
prodigious re-action of the fibres, may occasion
violent symptoms, which are never seen
in chronical disorders or distempers of languor,
in which the evacuatives, properly so called,
are, from that very quality, never, by much,
so necessary, and are, as I have before observed,
often contra-indicated. Atony, and
the want of action, are the cause of those
gatherings when there are any formed; when
they are evacuated by a purgative, the effect
is dissipated, but the cause which will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
produced them is considerably augmented:
there remain to be repaired both the evil
that actually exists, and that which the remedy
will have done; if for these a remedy
is not quickly provided, the effect re-produces
itself faster than before; and if way is given
to the employing purgatives a-new, the evil
is a second time augmented; besides that the
intestines are made thereby to contract indisposition
to stools, which hinders their
functions, till at length they arrive at such
a point that there is no obtaining evacuations
from them but by physic. In short, purgatives,
in the case of obstructions in the first
passages of weak persons, can produce no
diminution of the effect but by augmenting
the causes, nor give a momentary relief but
as they make the disease worse. And yet
this method is but too much followed; the
sick generally like it, to them it has an air
of quickness or dispatch; and, indeed, provided
that the failure of strength be not too
considerable, they find themselves relieved
for a few days. The evil, it is true, returns,
but they had rather impute it to the insufficiency
than to the operation of that remedy,
to which they have taken a liking. Besides,
the sick are ever for the present relief, and
few physicians have the courage to oppose
this weakness. Yet is it important, as well
in physic as in morality, to know when to
sacrifice the present to the future: a neglect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of this law peoples the world with wretches
and with valetudinarians. It were much to
be wished, that there should be inculcated
to many physicians, as well as to many patients,
that fine passage to be found in the
<i>Pathologia</i> of M. <span class="smcap">Gaubius</span>, upon all the
evils which are the consequence of the abuse
of purgatives<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.</p>

<p>Are not there, will it be said, some cases,
in which emetics and purgatives may be admitted
for the sick of whom I am treating?
Doubtless, some there are, but they are very
rare; and great attention is requisite not to
be mistaken as to the signs which seem to
indicate evacuatives, and which often depend
on a cause that is to be attacked by
remedies of quite another nature. I will
not enter into a discussion of these distinctions;
that would be quite out of place here; it is
enough for me to observe, that evacuatives
are rarely advisable in this disorder. M.
<span class="smcap">Lewis</span> is of opinion, “that a gentle emetic
may serviceably prepare the first passages
for the other remedies, but would not
have that exceeded;” a multitude of cases
have taught me, that even that might and
often ought to be omitted; and I have precedently
adduced two observations of M.
<span class="smcap">Hoffman</span>, which prove all the danger for
that remedy. But even, without recourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to experience, common sense alone may
suffice to persuade one, that a remedy which
gives convulsions, cannot be very proper for
a disorder which are the effects of repeated
convulsions.</p>

<p>It is by combating the cause that the evil
is to be destroyed; for as little as may every
day be removed, of that cause, one may be
pretty sure that the effect will disappear,
without the danger of a return. If it is
against the effect only that the procedure of
the cure is levelled, the work of each day is
not only of no service to the following one,
but almost always detrimental.</p>

<p>After having indicated what is to be avoided,
there remains to examine what can be
done. I have precedently specified the character
that the remedies ought to have; to
strengthen without irritating; there are some
that can answer those indications; indeed
the catalogue of them is not a long one, and
the two most efficacious are, doubtless, <i>the
bark and the cold bath</i>. The first of these
medicines has been looked upon, for more
than a century past, independently of its febrifuge
virtue, as one of the most powerful
strengtheners, and as an anodyne. The most
celebrated of the modern physicians look on
it as a specific in the disorders of the nerves.
I have already shewn, that it was an ingredient
in the prescription above quoted from
<span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>; and M. <span class="smcap">Vandermonde</span> employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
it with great success in the case of a
young man under his care, whom debauches
with women had thrown into a deplorable
condition<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. M. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span> prefers it to all
the other remedies; and M. <span class="smcap">Stehelin</span>, in
that letter of his which I have more than
once mentioned, says, he holds it the most
efficacious of any.</p>

<p>Twenty ages of exact and well considered
experiences have demonstrated that the cold
baths possess the same qualities. Dr. <span class="smcap">Baynard</span>
has more particularly proved the virtue
of them in the disorders produced by
self-pollution, and by excesses of venery;
especially in a case, where, independently of
the impotency and of the simple <i>gonorrhœa</i>,
there was so great a weakness, augmented,
indeed, by bleeding and by purgations, that
the patient was considered as at the gates of
death<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span> does not scruple affirming yet
more positively their efficacy. “Among all
the medicines (says he,) whether external
or internal, there is nothing can equal the
virtue of the cold bath.... It cools
the body more, strengthens the nerves
better, and promotes perspiration more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
effectually, than any medicine taken down
the throat can do, and will do as much
service in the <i>tabes dorsalis</i>, prudently used,
as every thing else put together<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.” It
ought even to be remarked, that the cold bath
has, as I have already said of the air, a particular
advantage, which is, that its action
depends less on the reaction, which is as much
as to say on the vital forces of nature, than
the action of the other remedies: these
only act upon the quick, but the cold bath
gives a spring even to the dead fibres.</p>

<p>The conjunction of the bark with the cold
bath stands indicated by the purity of their
virtues; they operated the same effects, and
being combined, they cure those disorders
which all the other remedies only serve to
make worse. In their qualities of strengthening,
of anodynes, of febrifuges, they re-invigorate,
they lessen the feverish and nervous
heat, they calm the irregular motions produced
by the spasmodic disposition of the
nervous system. They remedy the weakness
of the stomach, and very quickly dissipate
the pains which are the consequences of
it. They restore appetite, facilitate the digestion
and nutrition, they re-establish all
the secretions, and especially perspiration,
which renders them so efficacious in all the
catarrhal and cutaneous disorders; in short,
they are remedies for all the diseases caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
by weakness, provided that the patient does
not labor under indissoluble obstructions, inflammations,
abscesses, or internal ulcers,
conditions which even do not necessarily or
almost necessarily exclude, any thing more
than the cold baths, but which often allow
of the bark.</p>

<p>I saw, some years ago, a foreigner, who
might be of the age of about twenty-three or
twenty-four, and who, from his tenderest infancy,
had been subject to the torture of the
cruellest head-achs, and almost continual
ones considering the frequency and the length
of the fits, which were almost always accompanied
with a total loss of appetite. The
evil had been considerably made worse by
the use of bleeding, of evacuatives, of purgative
waters, of warm baths, of broths,
and a multitude of other remedies. I prescribed
for him the cold bath and the bark.
In a few days, the fits became weaker and
weaker, and much less frequent; the patient,
at a month’s end, thought himself almost
radically cured; the cessation of the remedies
and the bad weather renewed the fits,
but incomparably less violent than before.
He recommenced the same process of cure
the spring following, and his disorder came
to be so slight, that he judged he should
need no more of any application; I am persuaded
that the same recourse, once or twice
repeated, will radically cure him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>A man of eight and twenty years old, had,
for many years, been cruelly tormented with
an irregular gout, which seized constantly
his head, and occasioned dreadful distortions
of his face; he had consulted a number of
physicians, and tried remedies of various
kinds, and lately a medicinal wine composed
of the most penetrative aromatics, infused in
Spanish wine; all, and especially the last, had
increased his disorder; blisters had been applied
to his legs which brought on violent
symptoms; at this epoch it was that I was
consulted. I advised for him, a strong decoction
of bark and of camomile, which he
continued for six weeks, and which restored
him to more health, than he had enjoyed
for many years. It would be needless here
to adduce a great number of examples, especially
foreign to the case, to prove the
strengthening quality of these remedies, which
has been so long demonstrated, and of which
every thing in this disorder indicates the use;
an use of which the happiest successes have
confirmed the virtue.</p>

<p>When I employed the bark in a liquid
form, I ordered the decoction of one ounce
in twelve ounces of water, or, according to
the indication, of red wine, boiled for two
hours in a close vessel, to be taken, at three
ounces a time, three times a day. I
time the cold bath in the evening, when the
digestion of the dinner is intirely completed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
it contributes much to procure a quiet sleep.
I knew a young man, accustomed to self-pollution,
who used to pass the night in the
most sleepless disquiet, and who was every
morning bathed in his own colliquative
sweats; the night that followed the sixth
cold bath he slept five hours, and got up
in the morning without sweats, and much
refreshed.</p>

<p>Martials are a third remedy, so often used
in all cases of weakness, as not to need any
insistence here on their efficacy in quality of
strengtheners; as they contain nothing of
an irritating nature, they are extremely proper
in this disorder. They are given in substance
or in infusion; but the best preparation
is the chalybeate waters prepared by
nature, and especially the spaw-waters, one
of the most powerful tonics that are known,
and a tonic, so far from irritative, that it
softens any acridity that may be in the humors.
The gums, myrrh, the bitters, the
mildest aromatics may also be of use. It
must be the circumstances that must decide
the choice from among these different remedies.
The first of those that I have indicated,
merit, for the most times, the preference;
but there may cases occur which
require others; they should, in general, be
selected from the class of the nervous medicines,
taking for a guide of choice, the precautions
I have above specified. It is a disorder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of the nerves, and ought to be treated
as such; and treated so it has often been
with success, without the cause of it having
been known. It is a truth, and a truth demonstrated
by incontestable observations, that
the ignorance of this cause, and a neglect
thereto consequential of the precautions
which it exacts, has sometimes frustrated
prescriptions to all appearances the best indicated,
without the physicians being able
to penetrate the cause of their failure of
success.</p>

<p>I prescribed for the young man, whose
case is described in a fragment of his letters
(p. 34.) pills of which mirrh was the basis,
with a decoction of the bark; and this was
attended with the happiest success<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. “I
am every day (as he wrote me sixteen days
after his beginning these remedies) more
and more sensible of the great good they
do me; my head-achs are no longer either
so frequent or so violent: I have not them
now any more, unless when I apply close;
my stomach grows better; I have now but
rarely pains in my limbs.” At the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a month his cure was complete, except in
this, that he had not, nor perhaps ever will
have, the strength it is probable he would
have had but for his misconduct. The check,
which the machine receives in its growing
season, has consequences which are irreparable.
Oh, that this truth were but strongly
imprinted on the minds of youth! It has
been lately urged with great energy. “Youth”
(says M. <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>) “is the most important
season for forming a robust constitution.
Nothing is more to be dreaded than a premature
or excessive use of the pleasures of
venery: thence proceed weaknesses of
the eyes, vertigos, diminution of appetite,
and even an enfeeblement of the mental
powers. Bodies enervated in youth never
recover their original vigor: their old age
is accelerated and infirm, and their life
short<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.”</p>

<p>Sixteen hundred years before the times of
this great Naturalist, <span class="smcap">Plutarch</span>, in his
valuable work on the education of children,
had recommended the formation of their
constitution as a point of the highest importance.
“No care (says he) should be
neglected that can contribute to the elegance
and vigor of the body:” (the excesses
of which I am treating are detrimental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to both the one and the other;) “for”
(adds he) “the foundation for a healthy
old age is to be laid in youth: temperance
and moderation at this early time
of life, are a passport to a happy latter
season<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.”</p>

<p>To the account of the preceding case, in
which the success appears due to the bark,
I shall subjoin another, in which the cold
bath was the principal remedy.</p>

<p>A young man of a bilious constitution,
seduced to libidinous practices from the age
of ten years, had always been, from that
time, weak, languishing, and of an ill habit
of body: he had had some bilious disorders,
which it had been very difficult to
cure; he was extremely lean, pale, feeble,
melancholic. I prescribed for him the cold
bath, and a powder of cream of tartar,
martials, and a very little cinnamon. In
less than six weeks he acquired such a
strength as he had never before known.</p>

<p>One great advantage of the Spaw-waters
and of the bark is, that the use of them
agrees with milk, and suffers it to pass. The
Spaw-waters are not the only ones that have
this property. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> prescribed asses
milk, with a third of Seltzer-water. M.
<span class="smcap">de la Mettrie</span> has preserved to us a
curious observation of M. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
speaking of the Duke of ——, “This
amiable Duke (I translate literally) had
thrown himself out of the nuptial paradise;
I brought him into it again by the
use of Spaw-waters with milk<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.”</p>

<p>A weakness of the stomach which causes
the digestion to be too slow; acids; the want
of activity in the bile; the obstructions in the
intestines of the abdominal region, are the
principal causes that hinder the digestion of
the milk, and counter-indicate its use. The
waters which remedy all these causes cannot
but facilitate the digestion; and the bark,
which fulfils the same indications, may also
be very well combined with the milk. These
remedies may be employed, either precedently,
to prepare the passages, which is almost
always necessary, or at the same time.</p>

<p>In 1753 I restored, perfectly, a foreigner,
who had so exhausted himself with a woman
of the town, that he was grown incapable
of any act of virility; his stomach was
also extremely weakened, and the want of
nutrition and sleep had quite emaciated him.
At six in the morning he took six ounces of
the bark-decoction, to which he added a
spoonfull of Canary-wine: an hour afterwards
he took ten ounces of goats milk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
fresh drawn, with a little sugar, and an
ounce of orange-flower-water. He dined
on a cold roast fowl, with a glass of excellent
Burgundy, diluted with an equal part of
water. At six in the evening he took a second
dose of the bark; at half an hour after
six he went into the cold bath, in which he
staid ten minutes, and immediately on coming
out of it, went to bed. At eight in the
evening he took again the same quantity of
milk, and got up from nine till ten. Such
was the effect of these remedies, that at the
end of eight days, on seeing me come into
his room, he cried out to me, in a transport
of joy, that he had recovered <i>the external
sign of virility</i>, if I may make use of M.
<span class="smcap">Buffon’s</span> expression. In a month, he had
almost intirely retrieved his original vigor.</p>

<p>Some absorbent powders; some spoonfulls
of mint-water, often the addition of only a
little sugar; some pills of the extract of the
bark with mastic, which is itself an useful
remedy in this case, may also contribute to
prevent the disagreement of the milk. To
the mastic, or to the gum-dragon, might be
substituted that gum newly introduced in
some parts of England, under the name of
<i>Gumm. rubrum Gambiense</i>, upon which there
may be seen a small dissertation in that excellent
collection published by the new Society
of Physicians formed at London<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
It strengthens, it sweetens: which are the
two great indications in the diseases of which
I am treating.</p>

<p>However, if with all the care that may
be taken, it should be found impossible to
bear the milk, I should advise trying butter-milk.
I prescribed it with success for a
young man, in whom certain symptoms of
vergency to the hypochondriac disorder deterred
me from a recourse to milk itself.
The bilious drink the butter-milk with pleasure,
and are always the better for it; and
indeed it ought always to be preferred to
milk, where there is a great deal of heat, a
feverishness, an eresipelatous disposition;
but it is especially of very great service when
the venereal excesses produce an acute fever,
such as was that of which <span class="smcap">Raphael</span> died.
Notwithstanding the weakness in these erotic
fevers, the tonics would be hurtful;
bleeding is dangerous: the famous <span class="smcap">Johnston</span>,
who died Baron of Ziebendorff, above
fourscore years ago, positively forbad it in
this case<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. Too cooling a method of
cure does not succeed, as the observation of
M. <span class="smcap">Vandermonde</span> proves, and as I have
myself seen; but the butter-milk is of service,
provided it is not too unctuous. It
calms, it dilutes, it sweetens, it assuages the
thirst, it refreshes, and at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
nourishes and strengthens, which is of great
importance in this case; one symptom of
which is, that strength melts away in it
with an inconceivable quickness. M. <span class="smcap">Gilchrist</span>,
who does not lay any great stress
on milk in a hectic, commends greatly the
use of butter-milk in that very disorder<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<p>Since my last edition of this work, published
about four years ago, (it being now
1764,) I have been consulted by several persons
in a state of enervity or debility. Some
have been intirely cured. Many have received
considerable relief; others none at all.
When the disease is got to a certain head,
the most that can be hoped for is, that the
remedies will stop the progress of the disorder.
Of the successes of some of my patients I
have remained unacquainted.</p>

<p>In almost all my treatment of these cases,
milk has been the principal aliment; while
the bark, martials, chalybeate waters, and
the cold bath have been the remedies.
Some patients I put intirely into a milk diet;
others only took it once or twice a day.</p>

<p>The patient of whom I particularised the
case in the fifth Section, where I promised
an account of my method of management of
his disorder, lived for three months upon nothing
but milk, upon bread well-baked,
upon one or two quite new laid eggs, a day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and fair water, just drawn from the fountain.
His milk he took four times a day, twice
warm from the cow without bread, twice
warmed on the fire with some bread. The
remedies were an electuary composed of bark,
of conserve of orange-peel, and syrup of mint.
His breast was covered with an aromatic
strengthening plaister. His whole body was
every morning rubbed down with flannel.
He took as much exercise as he could bear,
both on horseback and foot, and especially
he kept much in the open air. His weakness,
and his complaints of his breast, hindered
me from advising him the cold bath at
that epoch. The success, however, of the
remedies was such, that his strength returned
to him, and his stomach was restored.
In a month’s time he was able to walk a
league on foot. His vomitings ceased intirely;
the pains of his breast were considerably diminished,
and for these three years last past
he continues in a very tolerable state of
health. Little by little he returned to his
usual aliments, having taken a distaste to
milk.</p>

<p>The parts of generation are always those
that recover their vigor the slowest. Often
too they never regain it, even though the
rest of the body appear to have recovered its
natural strength. In this case, it may be
literally prophesied, that the part which has
sinned, will be the part that shall die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>I have always found more facility in curing
those who, in the age of maturity, had
exhausted themselves by excesses, in a short
time, than those who, in a longer space of
it, had enervated themselves by pollutions,
more rarely practised, but which having been
begun in their tenderest youth, had hindered
their growth, and had never allowed them
to come to all their natural strength. The
first may be considered as having had a violent
illness, which has consumed all their
strength, but whose organs having acquired
all their perfection, however they may have
much suffered, yet, the cessation of the cause
of their illness, time, a good regimen, and
proper remedies, may restore them. Whereas
the others, having never let their constitution
come to good, how should they be
restored to what they never had? How
could they expect that art should operate
in the age of maturity, what they have
hindered nature from operating in the tender
season of youth and of puberty? Common
sense must tell one how chimerical such
a hope must be; and, indeed, my observations
every day prove to me, that young persons,
who have delivered themselves up to
this pollution, in their childhood, in their
earliest youth, and in the epoch of the unfolding
of puberty, an epoch which is a crisis
of Nature, for which its whole strength
is necessary to her; daily observation, I say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
proves to me, that such young persons must
never expect to be vigorous and robust:
they may think themselves very well off, if
they can compass the enjoying a moderate
state of health, exempt from great disorders
or great pains.</p>

<p>Those who trust to a tardy repentance,
having delayed it to an age, in which the
machine may preserve itself, when it is in
good order, but is not to be repaired without
great difficulty, ought not either to have
great hopes. After forty it is rare to grow
young again.</p>

<p>When I order the bark with wine, I do
not restrict the patient intirely to a milk
diet; but make him take the bark in the
morning and the milk at night. For some
patients, however, I have been obliged to
invert that order; the wine taken in the
morning not agreeing with their stomach,
and constantly making them vomit.</p>

<p>When I employ mineral waters, I make
them drink first some bottles pure, before I
proceed to have them mixed with milk.</p>

<p>When the disorder is inveterate it commonly
degenerates into a <i>cacochymia</i>, a general
depravation of the humors, or ill habit
of the body; the cure of which must be proceeded
upon before you attempt to restore
strength. In this case it is that evacuants
are sometimes indispensably necessary, and
prove of great service. Whereas restoratives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
nutritious aliments, milk, ordered in
these circumstances, may throw the patient
into a slow fever, and he will rather find his
strength diminish in proportion to the use
he makes of them.</p>

<p>When violent excesses shall have thrown
one suddenly into such a considerable weakness
as to give room of fear for the patient’s
life, recourse should be had to active cordials.
Spanish wines may be given him with
a little bread, or some good broths with
new laid eggs: he should be put to bed
directly, and have some flannels applied to
his breast, steeped in wine, warmed with
Theriaca.</p>

<p>As to those cases, in which venereal excesses
have occasioned an acute fever, bleeding
should not be used, unless indicated by
the fullness and hardness of the pulse;
and it is better to take the quantity of blood
at two different times bleeding, than all at
once. The white decoction, barley water
with a little milk, some doses of nitre, some
glisters with a decoction of mullein flowers,
some warm bathings for the feet; and as to
aliments, some veal-broth, thickened with
barley or the like grain; these are the remedies
indicated by right practice, and such as
I have seen succeed very happily and quickly,
in those cases in which I have employed
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The symptoms rarely require any particular
method of cure, and yield to the general
one. You may sometimes, however, join
external corroboratives to the internal ones,
where it may be proper to strengthen any
particular part. I have myself often advised,
with success, epithems or aromatic plaisters
for the breast. Nor is it sometimes unserviceable
to wrap the testicles in a soft flannel,
steeped in some corroborative liquid, and to
support them by means of a suspensory.</p>

<p>Here also may be placed what M. <span class="smcap">Gotter</span>
says: “I have sometimes cured the
<i>gutta serena</i>, occasioned by venereal excesses,
by employing internal corroboratives,
and errhines, or nasal cephalic powders,
which, by the slight irritation they produced,
determined a greater afflux of the
animal spirits to the optic nerve<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.”</p>

<p>It would be needless here to enter on
greater particularities of the method of cure;
whatever extension I might give them, they
would never be sufficient to guide the sick
without the assistence of a physician, to
whom they would be superfluous. I have,
indeed, treated the more largely of the regimen,
because that, when the disorder has
as yet made no great progress, that alone,
joined to the cessation of the cause, might
operate a cure, and that any one might confine
himself to it without any danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>There appears then nothing more for me
to say, before I terminate this part, but to
add the preservative cautions. I was sensible
that this article was wanting to the first
edition of this work, and that it was an unjustifiable
defect, from the importance of the
matter. A gentleman, celebrated in the
Republic of Literature for his works, and
yet more respectable for his talents, his
knowledge, and his personal qualities, than
for his name, and for the employments of
which he so worthily acquits himself, in one
of the first towns in Switzerland, M. <span class="smcap">Iselin</span>,
(I hope he will forgive my naming
him,) made me sensible of that my omission
in a very polite manner. I shall quote here
an extract of his letter with the more pleasure,
for its pointing out exactly what there
remained for me to do.</p>

<p>“I could wish (says he) to see a work
from your hand, in which you would explain
the means the most secure and the
least dangerous, by which parents, during
the time of education, and young persons,
when they are left to their own conduct,
might the best preserve themselves from
that violence of desires which urges them
to those excesses, whence arise such dreadful
diseases, or to disorders that disturb
the happiness of society and their own.
I do not doubt of there being a diet that
particularly favors continency. I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
think that a work that should teach it us,
combined with a description of the diseases
produced by impurity, would be
equivalent to the best treatises of morality
on this subject.”</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Iselin</span> is doubtless in the right; nothing
would be more important than the
combination of the two points he desires;
but then nothing would be more difficult
than the detaching them from the other
parts not only of moral but medicinal education.
To treat of this article apart,
that is to say, to treat of it well, it would
be necessary to establish a great number of
principles, which would swell too much this
little work, and which would, besides, be
very foreign to it. Some general precepts,
unconnected with the necessary principles
and divisions, would not only be of little
use, but might even become dangerous; so
that it is better to refer such a treatise to the
making part of a more considerable one,
upon the means of forming a good constitution,
and of giving a youth a firmly established
health; a matter which, though it
has been handled by very able authors, is,
hitherto, far, very far from being exhausted;
and upon which there remain a multitude
of extremely important things to be added,
as well as upon the disorders incident to that
season of life. So that, though it be against
my inclination, I will not here touch upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
this article. All that I can say is, that idleness,
inactivity, too long lying a-bed, too
soft a bed, a rich, aromatic, salt, or vinous
diet, dangerous or suspicious acquaintance,
licentious works, being the likeliest causes
of seduction into those excesses, they cannot
be too carefully avoided. Diet especially is
of extreme importance, and there is not attention
enough had to that particular. Those
who educate youth, ought to have ever present
to them that pathetic observation of
St. <span class="smcap">Jerom</span>: “The forges of Vulcan, the
internals of the Vesuvius and the Mount
Olympus do not burn with more flames,
than youth pampered with high meats,
and drenched with wines.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menjot</span>, one of <span class="smcap">Lewis</span> the XIVth’s
Physicians, from about the middle to the
end of the last century, mentions women,
that an excess of <i>hippocras</i> (spiced wine)
threw into a venereal extasy. The use of
wine and flesh-meats is so much the more
pernicious, for that while they augment the
force of the stimulations of loose desires,
they weaken at the same time that of reason,
which ought to resist them. “Wine
and animal food dull the soul,” says <span class="smcap">Plutarch</span>,
in his treatise <i>On the eating of flesh-meats</i>,
a work which ought to be generally
perused. The most ancient Physicians had
already known the influence of regimen over
the morals; they had the idea of a moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
medicinal-course; and <span class="smcap">Galen</span> has left us
upon that matter a small work, which is,
perhaps, the best upon that subject hitherto
extant. Conviction of the reality of his
promise cannot but follow its perusal.</p>

<p>“Let those (says he) who deny that the
difference of aliments can render some
temperate, others dissolute; some chaste,
others incontinent; some courageous, others
cowardly; some meek, others quarrelsome;
some modest, others overbearing; let those,
I say, who deny this truth, come to me;
let them follow my counsels as to eating
and drinking, and I promise them, that
they will find great helps therefrom towards
moral philosophy; they will especially
feel the faculties of their soul gather
greater strength; they will improve their
natural genius, they will acquire more
memory, more prudence, more diligence.
I will also tell them what kind of liquors,
what winds, what state of the air,
what climates they ought to shun or
chuse<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>, <span class="smcap">Plato</span>, <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>,
<span class="smcap">Plutarch</span>, had already left us some very
good things on this important matter, and
among the works which remain to us of the
Pythagorean <span class="smcap">Porphyry</span>, that zealous anti-christian
of the third century, there is one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
<i>upon the abstinence of the animal food</i>, in
which he reproaches <span class="smcap">Firmus Castricius</span>,
to whom he addresses it, for his having
quitted the vegetable diet, though he himself
had owned it was the fittest to preserve
health, and to facilitate the study of philosophy;
and he adds, “Since you have taken
to the eating of flesh-meat, your own experience
has taught you, that that confession
of yours was well grounded.” There
are some very good things in that work.</p>

<p>The most efficacious preservative, the
most infallible one is, doubtless, that which
is pointed out by that great man, who, of
all men has the best known his fellow creatures,
and all their ways; who has not only
seen what they actually are, but what they
have been, what they ought to be, and what
they are capable of becoming; who has the
most truly loved them; who has made the
greatest efforts in their favor, and who has
been the most cruelly persecuted by them.
“Watch with care (says he) over the young
man. Do not leave him alone either by
day or by night. Sleep, at least, in the
same room with him. From the instant
that he shall have contracted that habit,
the most fatal one that a young man can
inslave himself to, he will carry to the
grave the melancholic effects of it. He
will have his body and his heart for ever
enervated by it.” I refer to the work itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
for a perusal of all the excellent things
he has said on this matter<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.</p>

<p>The description of the danger, upon the
abandoning one’s self to such vitious practices,
is perhaps one of the most powerful motives
of correcting one’s self of them: it is a
dreadful picture, and fit to make one start
back with horror and affright. Let us assemble
in one point of view the principal features
of it. A general wasting of the whole
machine; an enfeeblement of all the corporal
senses and of all the faculties of the
soul; loss of imagination and memory; imbecillity;
contempt; shame; the ignominy
such viciousness drags after it; all the functions
of life disturbed, suspended, or painfully
executed; long, vexatious, unaccountable,
disgustful diseases; acute and constantly
regenerating pains; all the infirmities or
evils of old age, in the age of youth and
vigor; an unaptitude for all those occupations
for which man is born; the vile
character to act of being an useless burthen
to the earth; the mortifications to which
such a character is daily exposed; a distaste
for all worthy pleasures; a dull melancholy;
an aversion for society and consequently
for one’s self; a horror of life, the
dread of temptations every moment to suicide;
an anguish worse than pain; a remorse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
worse than anguish, a remorse which daily
increasing, and which doubtless taking a
new force, when the soul is no longer
weakened by its ties to the body, will perhaps
serve for a torment to all eternity, for
an unextinguishable fire. See here the sketch
of the fate reserved for those who proceed as
if they had not it to dread!</p>

<p>Before I quit this article of the method of
cure, I ought to observe to the patients,
and it is an observation equally extensible to
all who labor under chronical disorders, especially
when they are accompanied with
weakness; that they ought not to hope that,
in a few days, those evils can be repaired or
removed, which are the produce of the errors
of years. They must lay their account with
being obliged to endure the tediousness of a
long cure, and to confine themselves scrupulously
to all the rules laid down for their
regimen. If sometimes they appear trifling
or minute to them, it is because they themselves
are not fit judges of the degree of their
importance; it would be better for them
constantly to repeat to themselves, that the
irksome tediousness of the most rigid method
of cure is still preferable to a state of any
the slightest disease. Be it allowed me to
observe, that for one disorder that remains
uncured through improper treatment, there
are a number, which the indocility of the
patients renders incurable, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the most well judged assistance given on the
part of the physician.</p>

<p>For the securing success, <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>
required that the patient, the physician, the
attendants, should all equally do their duty;
if this concurrence was less rare, the happy
issues of disorders would be more frequent.
“Let the patient (says <span class="smcap">Aridæus</span>) have a
good heart, and join forces with the physician
against the disease<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.” I have
seen the most stubborn ones yield to the
establishment of this harmony; and recent
observations have demonstrated to me, that
the virulence of even cancerous disorders has
submitted to methods of cure, directed perhaps
with some skill, but especially executed
with a docility and a regularity of which the
successes constituted the best praise.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Accessory, or Relative <span class="smcap">Diseases</span>.</i></span></h2>

<h3>SECTION XI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Nocturnal Pollutions.</i></span></h3>

<p>I have shown the dangers of an over-abundant
evacuation of the seminal liquid,
by excesses of venery, and by self-pollution:
I have also observed, in the beginning
of this work, that it was to be lost
both by nocturnal pollutions through libidinous
dreams, and by that running called the
simple <i>gonorrhœa</i>. I shall briefly examine
these two disorders.</p>

<p>Such are the laws that unite the soul to
the body, that even when the senses are
locked up by sleep, the soul is taken up with
ideas transmitted to it in the day.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Res, quæ in vita usurpant homines, cogitant, curant, vident,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Quæque aiunt vigilantes, agitantque, ea si cui in somno accidunt</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Minus mirum est.</i></div>
<div class="attr"><span class="smcap">Acc.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another law of this union is, that without
disturbing this imprisonment of the other
senses; or, that I may express myself less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
equivocally than in metaphor, without restoring
to them their sensibility to external
impressions, the soul can, during sleep, beget
the motions necessary to the execution
of those acts of the will, which the ideas on
which she busies herself suggests to her.
Taken up with ideas relative to the pleasures
of love, delivered up to lascivious
dreams, those objects which she paints to
herself, produce upon the organs of generation
the same motions that they would have
produced in the time of being awake, and the
act naturally consummates itself in reality,
if it is consummated in the imagination.
The accident to <span class="smcap">Horace</span> in one of the
places of repose on his journey to Brundusium,
is well known.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Hic ego mendacem stultissimus usque puellam,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Ad mediam noctem expecto: somnus tamen aufert</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Intentum veneri: tum immundo somnia visu</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Nocturnam maculant vestem, ventremque supinum.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The organs of generation, on the other
hand, when they are the first irritated,
sometimes excite nothing but the imagination,
and bring on dreams, which terminate
as the precedently mentioned ones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
These principles serve to explain the different
kinds of these nocturnal pollutions.</p>

<p>The first is that which proceeds from an
over-abundance of the seminal liquid; it is
what persons in the vigor of life, who are
sanguine, hearty, and continent, are liable
to. The heat of the bed coming to rarefy
the humors, and the seminal liquid being
more susceptible of rarefaction than any
other, the irritated <i>vesiculæ</i> hurry away the
imagination, which, being destitute of the
helps that would discover the illusion to her,
delivers herself wholly up to it; the idea of
coition produces the ultimate effect of it, the
ejaculation. In this case, this evacuation is
not a disease; it is rather a favorable crisis,
that disembarrasses from a humor, which,
in too great an abundance, or too long retained,
might be rather hurtful: and though
some Physicians, who have no faith but in
what they themselves have seen, have denied
it, it is not the less true that this liquid may,
by its over-abundance, produce disorders
different from the priapism or the <i>furor uterinus</i>.
I hope I may be allowed a short digression
on this question; it is not a foreign
one to my subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Galen</span> has preserved to us the history of
a man and woman to whom the excess of the
seminal liquid was the cause of bad health,
and who were both of them cured by renouncing
that continency to which they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
taxed themselves<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>; and he looks on the
retention of this humor as capable of producing
very bad effects. I had, at Montpelier,
occasion to make an observation, in
every point similar to that great man’s. A
widow, of a healthy vigorous habit of body,
of near forty years of age, who had for a
long time been accustomed to the enjoyments
of the nuptial bed, and had been for
some years deprived of them, used, from
time to time, to fall into such violent hysteric
fits, that she lost the use of her senses by
them: no remedy could dissipate those fits;
there was no way to make her come out of
them but by strong frictions of the genital
parts, which procuring to her a convulsive
tremor, followed by a copious ejaculation,
she, that instant, recovered her senses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zacutus Lusitanus</span> relates a case
very similar to this. “A girl (says he) was
in a very violent convulsive paroxysm, so
as to be on the point of suffocation by it;
without feeling, without sense, a general
tremor over her whole body, her eyes set;
having tried all other remedies in vain, I
ordered an acrid irritative pessary to be applied,
which produced a copious spermatic
evacuation, and she immediately recovered
her senses<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> has also preserved to us
the history of a nun, who could not be recovered
out of an hysterical paroxysm but by
the excital of that evacuation. And <span class="smcap">Zacutus</span>,
in the same work I have just quoted,
speaks of two men, to whose health
the suppression of the pleasures of love was
a detriment. The one was attacked with a
swelling at the navel which no remedy could
diminish, and which was dissipated on his
marrying: the other, weakened by his debauches
in that way, quitted them all on a
sudden; six months afterwards he had vertigos,
and soon afterwards some attacks of
a real epilepsy, which were imputed to some
disorders of his stomach. Accordingly they
gave him stomachics, which exasperated his
disorder, and he died in a violent fit of the
epilepsy. On being opened, every thing
was found in proper order, except the <i>vesiculæ
seminales</i> and the <i>vasa deferentia</i>, which
were found full of a sperm, green, and in
some places ulcerous<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.</p>

<p>A Physician, respectable for his skill and
for his age, and who long attended the Austrian
armies in Italy, told me, he had remarked,
that those German soldiers who
were not married, and who lived chastely,
were often attacked with fits of epilepsy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
priapisms, or nocturnal pollutions; accidents
which proceeded from an over-abundant
secretion of the seminal liquid; which
perhaps too had the more stimulative acridity
from the heat of the country, where
the diet is also more rich.</p>

<p>We have from the same Dr. <span class="smcap">Jaques</span>,
whom I have quoted in the second Article
of this work, a thesis<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, of which M. <span class="smcap">de
la Mettrie</span> has given a translation<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>,
in which he adduces many examples of diseases
produced by a privation of the pleasures
of venery; and M. <span class="smcap">de la Mettrie</span>
mentions another work upon cloistered virginity,
of which the object is the same.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Zindel</span> published at Basle, about
fifteen years ago, a dissertation, in which he
has collected together, scattered observations
on the diseases produced by too rigid a chastity<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.
And here may be placed what
M. <span class="smcap">de Sauvages</span> says of the dangers of a
rigorous chastity to those women with whose
constitutions it does not agree; they are so
much the more the victims of the warmth
of it, the more careful they are to conceal
it; they pine, and fall into melancholy,
disrelish of life, emaciation, and pollutions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
He adds a case, which furnishes perhaps an
example of the severest trial to which a conflict
of constitution and virtue could expose
the party distracted between them: it is that
of a young girl, who, devoured with a raging
fire, and yet preserving her soul pure,
with an astonishing fortitude was subject to
pollutions even in those moments in which
she was deploring her misfortune at the feet
of her confessor, a decrepid, loathsome old
man.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>“A young girl, who marries an old husband”
(said a new married woman to her
female friend) “had better throw herself
into the river, with a mill-stone about her
neck.”</p>

<p>In short, not to mention many others,
M. <span class="smcap">Gaubius</span> places excessive continency in
the class of causes of diseases. “It is rare,
indeed, (he says,) that it produces any
evils, and yet it has been known so to do,
in some men, born with a warm constitution,
and who breed a great deal of the
seminal liquid, and in some women<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.”
And he proceeds to an enumeration of those
disorders. The existence then of them is
not to be denied; but the rarity of them
may at the same time be affirmed, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
in the present age, which seems to be
the age of sensuality: and, in truth, we see
every day that gross mistake committed, of
attributing indistinctly to this cause, that is
to say, to a need of employment for the
organs of generation, all the diseases which
attack marriageable persons of both sexes,
and in advising marriage to them as the
only remedy; a remedy often misjudged,
often even noxious, because it cannot destroy
the complaints which proceed from
other causes of disorder, and may add to
such evils, those which pregnancy and lying-in
commonly produce in persons of a languishing
state of health. I return to the
subject of pollutions.</p>

<p>I have shown, that the first kind of them,
produced by that over-abundance of the seminal
liquid, which it lessens by evacuation,
is not of itself an evil; but it may become
one by recurring too frequently, and
at times when the over-abundance no longer
exists. I have also already observed,
that one evacuation disposed for a second,
and so on, so great is the force of habit,
which consists in this, that the reiteration
of the same motions gives them the greater
facility, insomuch that they reproduce themselves
on the slightest cause; an observation
of great use towards the understanding the
animal œconomy, upon which <span class="smcap">Galen</span>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
especially M. <span class="smcap">Maty</span><a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>, have said some
excellent things; and still it has not been
treated of to the bottom. From the habit
then there results this inconveniency, that
these evacuations become a consequence of it,
independently of the want, and when it no
longer exists. Then they are extremely pernicious,
and have all the dangers of an excessive
evacuation procured by other means.
<span class="smcap">Satyrus</span> surnamed <span class="smcap">Gragropilex</span>, residing
at Thasus, had had, from the age of
twenty-five, frequent nocturnal pollutions:
nay, sometimes the liquid would come from
him in the day time. He died of a consumption
in his thirtieth year<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Zimmerman</span> told me of a man of
a remarkably fine genius, to whom pollutions
had caused the loss of all the activity
of his understanding, and whose body was
exactly in that condition described by <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>
(Section I.) In that Section too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
may be seen the evils which <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> observed
consequential to pollutions. The most
common symptoms, when the disorder has
not as yet made any great progress, are, a
continual oppression, most considerable in the
morning, and acute pains of the loins. Some
months ago I was consulted about a laborer
in the vines, aged about fifty years, before
that time very robust, but whom frequent
pollutions had, for three or four months, so
prodigiously weakened, that he could not
work but a few hours a day. Often he was
even totally debarred from it by pains in his
loins, which confined him to his bed, and
he every day grew leaner. I gave him some
advice, of which I could not learn the execution
or effect.</p>

<p>I knew a man who had become deaf for
some weeks on his neglecting a cold, and
who, on his having a nocturnal pollution,
was, the next day, much deafer than ordinary,
with great restlessness and anxiety;
and another, whose weakness was owing to
many causes, and who, after a pollution,
wakes under the greatest oppression, and
with so general a numbness, that he is for
an hour like a paralytic, and remains the
whole day after under a great dejection.</p>

<p>In this first class may be put the pollutions
of those, who, having been accustomed to frequent
emissions, suddenly suspend them. Such
were those of a woman whom <span class="smcap">Galen</span> makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
mention; she had been, for some time, in
the state of widow-hood, and the retention
of the spermatic liquid brought upon her
disorders of the <i>uterus</i>. In her sleep she
had convulsive motions of her loins, arms,
and legs, which were accompanied with an
abundant emission of a thick matter, with
the same sensations as in the act of coition<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.
A female dancer had received accidentally
a slight hurt near her left breast; her surgeon
prescribed to her rather a strict diet,
and especially forbad her those pleasures to
which she was pretty much accustomed.
The third night of the privation, to which
she had submitted without minding the injunctions
of diet, she had a pollution, which
returning several times the following nights,
made her visibly fall away, and caused to her
violent pains of the loins. Her wound, however,
did not fail of healing, in a great measure,
and would have been quite so, if she
had been observant of the surgeon’s rules of
diet, who, firm in the principles of his art,
continued his prohibition of venery, and bled
and purged her. Wearied out, at length,
and weakened, she left off his remedies, and,
resuming her usual course of life, her weakness
and her pains quickly went off.</p>

<p>But do not let any one, by any means,
from this last mentioned observation, conclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
against the utility of the precepts
of the most skillful masters in the art
of surgery, who, grounding it on other
observations, strictly forbid coition to the
wounded; there is no practitioner that might
not easily have convinced himself how pernicious
it must be to them. I shall only adduce
one example, in which self-pollution
was mortal, and of which G. <span class="smcap">Fabri</span> de
Hilden has preserved to us the history.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cosmus Slotan</span> had amputated the
hand of a young man, that was shattered
by a gun-shot wound. As he knew
him to be of a very hot constitution, he had
strictly forbid him any commerce with his
wife, whom he likewise apprized of the
danger. But when all fear of the worst accidents
was dissipated, and the cure was
proceeding in a fair way, the patient finding
desires come upon him, for which his wife
refused to have the complaisance he wanted
of her, he, without coition, procured to
himself an emission of the <i>semen</i>, which was
immediately followed by a fever, by a delirium,
by convulsions, and other violent
symptoms, of which he died in four days
time<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.</p>

<p>I knew a young married man, who, having
inconsiderately thrown himself out of
the seat of a <i>cabriolet</i>, (a chaise,) fell on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
side; the hind-wheel went over his foot,
between the heel and the ancle-bone; there
was neither fracture nor luxation, but a considerable
contusion: finding himself recovered
at the end of five days, he proceeded
with his bride as if he had had no such accident.
Two hours afterwards his leg swelled,
with the most unsufferable torture, and
he had a strong fever, which lasted thirty
hours.</p>

<p>But return we to the point. It is of great
importance early to prevent the progress of
habit; and whatever may be the first cause
of the pollutions, not to suffer them to grow
upon one. When they have been a long
while upon one, they are very hard to cure.
“There is no disorder (says <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span>)
that more torments the patients, nor gives
more trouble to physicians, than nocturnal
pollutions, when they have lasted a
long time, and become habitual, especially
if they return every night. The very
best remedies are almost always in vain
employed; they even often do more harm
than good<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.”</p>

<p>All the Physicians who have written on
this distemper have asserted, that the cure
of it is extremely difficult; and all the Physicians
who occasionally have had it under
their cure, have themselves found it so; nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
is there any room for being surprized at it.
Unless one either restore to the organs their
strength, and diminish their irritability during
the time that passes between two pollutions,
which is impossible; or on a sudden
prevent the return of lascivious dreams,
which it is not easy to do, one may be sure
that the pollution will return, and destroy
almost all the good that may have been operated
by the small quantity of remedy applied
since the last: so that from the term
of one pollution to that of another, the
ground that may have been gained must be
infinitely little, and a great number of remedies
must be accumulated before any sensible
good effect can be obtained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coelius Aurelianus</span> has collected
together the best things that the antients
have said on the management in this
case.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, He would have the patient avoid,
as much as possible, all libidinous ideas.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, That he should lie on a bed of
a hard and refreshing matter; that he
should apply to his loins a thin plate of lead,
and to all the parts which are the seat of
the disorder, spunges soaked in water and
vinegar, and cooling things, as the <i>balaustæ</i>,
<i>acacia</i>, <i>hypocist</i>, the <i>psillium</i>.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, That he should use no diet but
of cooling and yet not laxative articles of
meat and drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, He advises restoratives, or analeptics.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, The use of the cold-bath.</p>

<p><i>Sixthly</i>, Not to sleep on one’s back, but
on one side, or prone.</p>

<p>All this advice is full of sensible things;
but let us examine more distinctly the indication
that presents itself. It is to diminish
the quantity of the seminal liquid, and to
prevent those lascivious dreams. Now generally
speaking, the diet and the regimen
are much more proper to obtain these ends,
than medicines. The fittest aliments are
those which are procured from the vegetable
kingdom, pulse, herbs, grain, and fruits.
Among the meats, those which contain the
least substance. In both the one and the
other class, the choice should fall on those
which have the least acridity. It has been
precedently remarked, what an influence
this regimen has on the tranquillity of sleep;
it cannot be too much recommended to persons
afflicted with nocturnal pollutions, to
whom that tranquillity is so necessary. They
ought especially to renounce suppers, or at
least never sup but lightly: this single attention
contributes more to operate a cure than
all the medicines.</p>

<p>Some years ago I knew a young man,
who had almost every night a nocturnal pollution,
and who had before had some fits
of the <i>night-mare</i>. A barber-surgeon had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
ordered him to drink every night, at his lying
down, some glasses of warm water; which,
without diminishing the pollutions, augmented
the other complaint. Both these evils
then united, and returned every night. The
dream of the <i>night-mare</i> was the phantom
of a female, which caused at the same time
his pollution. Weakened by the double disorder,
and by the privation of a tranquil
sleep, he was going fast into a consumption.
I prescribed his taking nothing for supper
but a little bread and some raw fruits, and,
as he went to bed, to drink a glass of cold
water, with fifteen drops of the anodine
mineral liquor of <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span>. It was not
long before he regained his tranquillity of
sleep; his two disorders left him intirely,
and he soon recovered his strength.</p>

<p>Heavy, indigest meats, game or venison,
especially at night, are a perfect poison for
this disorder; and, I repeat it, without leaving
off suppers, and especially of animal food,
all the other remedies can be of no service.
Wine, spirituous liquors, coffee, are, in many
lights, hurtful. The best drink is that of
pure water; or there may, to advantage, in
each bottle of it be dissolved a drachm of
nitre.</p>

<p>The precept that <span class="smcap">Coelius</span> gives for
avoiding soft beds, is of the greatest importance.
There should be no feathers suffered
in it: straw is preferable to horse-hair, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
I have known some patients receive benefit
from covering the mattrass with leather.</p>

<p>The advice against not lying on one’s
back, is especially necessary; this posture, in
the night, contributing to render the sleep
the more agitated, and to heat more the
parts of generation.</p>

<p>In short, as habit has, in this case, a very
great influence, and that to break it is the
capital point, the following observation may
furnish a means of succeeding. I owe it to
an Italian gentleman, respectable for his
virtues, and one of the worthiest characters
I ever remember to have known. He consulted
me upon a disorder of a very different
kind; but in order to give me the
clearer notions of his present case, he let me
into the history of his health. He had five
years before then been troubled with frequent
pollutions, which totally exhausted
him. Upon this he took, over-night, a firm
resolution to wake of himself the first moment
that the appearance of a female should
strike his imagination; and, before he fell
asleep, he took care to dwell fixedly and
strongly on this idea. This remedy was attended
with the happiest success; the idea
of the danger, and his resolution of waking
of himself, being closely, over-night, linked
with the idea of a woman, reproduced themselves,
in the midst of his sleep, at the same
time, and jointly with this last: he waked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
at the time, and this precaution, repeated
for some nights, dissipated the disorder.</p>

<p>But I would not have those two last instances
inspire too much security: there are
cases against which the best remedies must
fail; that which <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> relates<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> is
an example; and it would be right to give
before-hand to patients the advice which he
gave to his; it is this; that without a long
perseverance in the use of proper remedies,
there is no efficacy to be hoped for from
them; or rather, that in such a case, as
that the regimen is the great essential, it is
often only by means of a long observance of
it, that any perceptible relief can be obtained.
If remedies are employed, they ought
to be regulated by the same indications as
the regimen. It is not long since I knew a
copious bleeding carry off this disorder. Nitrous
powders, lemonades, acid spirits, almond
emulsions, may be of service.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span> prescribed for the self-pollutor,
who, after having renounced his
infamous practices, had fallen under the disorder
of nocturnal pollutions, the following
powder:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>℞. <i>C. C. pphicè ppati. Ossis sepiæ ana unc.
ss. Succini cum instillat. Olei tartar. per
deliquium ppat. dr.</i> ii. <i>Cascar. dr.</i> i.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Of which he took one drachm over-night,
with black cherry-water; and in the morning
the Seltzer waters with milk; his drink,
a ptisan of <i>santal</i>; the China-root, <i>cichoreum</i>,
<i>scorzonera</i>, and <i>cinnamon</i>. With
these helps, and a proper diet, the patient
got well in a few weeks. M. <span class="smcap">Zimmerman</span>,
by means of the same powder, has
cured “very frequent pollutions, attended
with the common languor in that case,
and which had lasted for several years, in
a young man of twenty.” It is not easy
to explain how this powder, which is but
a simple absorbent, can do any good; but I
have seen good effects from camphire.</p>

<p>Another sort of pollutions is such as are incident
to Hypochondriacs. The circulation
proceeds in them but slowly, especially in
the veins of the Hypogastrium, which is
specifically the reason why the parts from
which those veins bring back the blood are
often obstructed; the nerves are easily put
into motion; the humors have a character
of acridity extremely fit to irritate; their
sleep is commonly disturbed with dreams:
here you have many causes of pollution, and
indeed they are much subject to them. “The
imagination (says M. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>) often,
during sleep, produces emissions of the
seed. The most sedentary of the men of
letters, and the splenetic, are liable to this
accident; and the efflux of the seed is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
often so considerable, as to cause them to
fall into an atrophy<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.” This disorder has
for them so much the more vexatious consequences,
for that they never give a loose to
any excesses of this kind, without being extremely
incommoded, as M. <span class="smcap">Fleming</span> has
happily expressed it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Non Veneri crebro licet unquam impune litare.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For them there is but one method of cure,
which is, to attack the principal disorder.
The removal of the obstructions is the first
thing to be done; after which the cold-bath
should be used, and that salutary bark which
God preserve to us. Then is truly the case
of recourse to those two powerful remedies,
with which martials may be allied. If an
attention to the choice of aliments is necessary
in all cases, it is particularly so in this.
The Hypochondriacs, in general, perform
their digestions very ill; the ill-digested aliments
produce flatulent turgescences, which
disturbing the circulation, dispose to pollutions
in two ways; first, by obstructing the
return of the blood in the veins of the genitals;
secondly, by disturbing the tranquillity
of sleep, and thereby consequently disposing
to dreams. Thence sensibly appears
the reason why <span class="smcap">Pythagoras</span> forbad his
disciples the eating flatulent aliments, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
he, wisely, considered as detrimental both to
the clearness and strength of the intellectual
functions, and to corporal chastity. Besides
the two reasons which I have given, I might
venture to point out a third, which I have
strongly had room to suspect in two patients;
and that is, the expansion of the air,
disengaged from the fluids in the <i>corpus cavernosum</i>,
which produced an erection, together
with the venereal pruriency. It is
now well known that all our liquids are impregnated
with this fluid, but that so long
as they are in perfect health, that fluid is,
as it were, imprisoned, and deprived of all
elasticity. Great Naturalists have been of
opinion, that there were but two ways of
restoring to it its elasticity; the one, a considerably
greater degree of heat than is observed
in the animal body; and the other,
putrefaction. But a multitude of observations
of disorders produced by the air so dilated,
have proved, that, independently of
these two causes, there were other alterations
in the fluids, which would have the
same effect, and these alterations appear the
most frequent in Hypochondriacs: so that
it is not wonderful that the cavernous parts
should be the seat of the expansion of this
diseased air: on the contrary, there is no
part which appears more likely to be exposed
to it; and if attention has not thereto
been given before now, it is probably rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
for want of observers than of observableness.
Observations, however, clearly evince the
necessity of avoiding those aliments which,
abounding more than others in air, are the
more hurtful, both by that which separates
from them in the first passages, and by that
which they convey into the blood. Who
does not know that new beer, which is extremely
flatulent, occasions violent erections?
Since my last edition of this work, I
have seen that M. <span class="smcap">Thierry</span>, one of the
most learned Physicians, and of the most celebrated
practitioners of France, has taken
notice of these flatulent erections.</p>

<p>And here may be added, as bearing some
affinity to this last kind of pollution, and
principally attacking such as are melancholically
affected, a disease that might be called
a <i>furor genitalis</i>. It differs from a Priapism,
and from the Satyriasis. I shall describe it
by an observation already published in the
first Latin edition of this work, and omitted
in the French one.</p>

<p>A man about fifty years of age had labored
under it for twenty-four years, and in
all that long term could not pass twenty-four
hours without recourse to women, or to that
horrid supplement, self-pollution; and commonly
he would reiterate the act several
times a day. The seed was thin, acrid, unprolific,
and the evacuation very quick. His
nerves were excessively weakened: he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
violent fits of melancholy, and vapors; his
faculties were stupified, his hearing very indifferent
or slow, his eyes extremely weak;
in short, he died in the most wretched condition.
I had never prescribed any thing
for him; but he had taken a great number
of remedies. Many of them had done him
no service; all those that were of a hot nature
had been prejudicial to him. Only
bark, infused in wine, by order of M. <span class="smcap">Albinus</span>,
had relieved him: and the authority
of this great Physician is a fresh, and,
surely, a respectable testimony, in favor of
that remedy.</p>

<p>Among the Consultations of M. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span>
may be seen a case nearly similar to
this; the pruriency was almost continual,
and body and soul equally enervated<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<h3>SECTION XII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The <span class="smcap">Gleet</span>, or simple <span class="smcap">Gonorrhœa</span>.</i></span></h3>

<p>“The <i>Gonorrhœa</i> (says <span class="smcap">Galen</span>, who
knew none but the simple one)
is a running of the seed without erection.”
Many authors, in all ages, make mention of
it, and <span class="smcap">Moses</span>, the most antient of all. In
the observations of <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span> may be
seen the example of a Mountaineer, whose
disorder seems to have been a marasmus, and
who had an involuntary evacuation of the
urine and seminal liquid<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. M. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>
seems, however, as to the seminal
efflux, to have set down this disorder among
the number of doubtful things. “You may
(says he) read in books of physic, that the
seed has sometimes run, without its being
perceived or felt. But this disorder must
be extremely rare, as I know of no instance
in the which the seed has come out
without some degree of titillation: or else
it was not the true seminal liquid separated
in the testicles, and amassed in the
seminal vesicules, though I have seen the
liquid of the <i>prostatæ</i> flow forth<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.” This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
authority is, doubtless, very respectable; but
besides that M. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> does not decisively
pronounce on this point, he has
against him all the Physicians; and, not to
go out of his own school, one of his most
illustrious disciples, <span class="smcap">Gaubius</span>, admits the
evacuation of the seed without sensation.
My own observations leave me no room to
doubt of the existence of both the one and
the other disorder. I have seen men who,
after a virulent <i>gonorrhœa</i>, after excesses of
venery, or self-pollutions, had a constant
running at the yard, but which did not render
them incapable of erection and ejaculation;
they even complained, that a single
ejaculation weakened them more than a running
of some weeks; which is an evident
proof that the liquid of these two evacuations
was not the same; and that that
which comes by a <i>gonorrhœa</i> flows only
from the <i>prostatæ</i>, from some other glands
about the urethra, from the follicular cellules
distributed over its whole length, or,
in short, from the dilated exhaling vessels.
I have seen other men, who, like the first,
had a continual running, but a running
which weakened them much more, and
which rendered them incapable of all venereal
pruriency, of all erection, and, from that
very circumstance, of all ejaculation, though
the testicles had no appearance of any disqualification
for their functions. It seems to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
demonstrated, that, in these last, the true
testicular semen came away without sensation.
Those then who know the structure
of the parts of generation, will easily bring
themselves to believe, that the first case must
be much more frequent than the last; but
of the last they will also readily conceive the
possibility of existence. The authors of the
greatest exactness have called that the true
<i>gonorrhœa</i>, in which they apprehended that
the matter of the running was the genuine
semen; the other they termed the <i>spurious</i>
or <i>catarrhal gonorrhœa</i>.</p>

<p>The dangers of the genuine running are
very considerable. In the beginning of the
first Section, <i>On the Symptoms</i>, the description
by <span class="smcap">Aretæus</span> has been quoted. “How
(says he, in the same place) can one avoid
the being weakened, when that which is
so essential to the vital forces is continually
slipping away, in waste. It is in the
seminal liquid alone that eminently resides
the strength of man.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Celsus</span>, who lived before the times of
<span class="smcap">Aretæus</span>, says positively, “That the running
of the seed without venereal sensation,
brings on a consumption<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>, son of <span class="smcap">Zacharias</span>, more commonly
known by the name of <span class="smcap">Actuarius</span>,
in a work which he composed for the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
of the Ambassador whom the Emperor of
Constantinople was sending to the North, is,
upon this point, of the same opinion with
the authors I have already quoted. “If
(says he) the running of the seed, which
proceeds without erection, and without
sensation, sails for any time, it produces
necessarily a consumption and death; for
the most balsamic part of the humors and
the animal spirits are thereby dissipated
and lost<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.”</p>

<p>Some of the most modern authors agree
also, on this head, with the antients. “The
whole body (says <span class="smcap">Sennertus</span>) becomes
emaciated, and especially the back; the
patients grow weaker and weaker; they
languish; they have pains in the loins;
they turn hollow-eyed<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> ranks this <i>gonorrhœa</i> among
the causes of the palsy; and it may be remarked,
that he admits in this place a <i>gonorrhœa</i>
of pure seed. “The palsy (says he)
which comes from a <i>gonorrhœa</i>, is incurable,
because the body is exhausted<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>On this matter there may also, in an excellent
dissertation of M. <span class="smcap">Koempf</span>, be found
some interesting observations<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.</p>

<p>This disorder may draw its origin from
many remote causes. The proximate cause
is always unitedly constituted of a defectiveness
or depravity in the liquids, of which the
running consists, they being too thin, and
often too acrid; and of a great relaxation of
the parts. The defect in the liquids denotes
a want of elaboration, which is owing to a
general weakness; this requires tonic remedies,
which the weakness of the organs also
indicates; the coincident circumstances determine
the choice of them. It would be
out of place to enter here on all the relative
particulars, and upon which there may be
found instructive lights in many medical writers,
and especially in <span class="smcap">Sennertus</span>, author
of the best compendium of practical physic
that we have.</p>

<p>The same remedies as are pointed out in
the course of this work, against the other
consequences of pollution, are applicable in
this case; the cold-bath, the bark, martials,
and corroboratives. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> says, that
the <i>hepatica</i> (liverwort) produces excellent
effects (<i>egregios sane præstat usus</i>) in the inveterate
<i>gonorrhœa</i>, where it depends on the
relaxation of the organs<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>. Sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
to direct the tendency which habit gives to
humors towards the same part, it may not
be amiss to begin by some laxatives: there
are even some great Physicians, who have attributed
to them an almost specific efficacy
against this disorder; experience yet more
than reason has proved to me the contrary.
Those who will give themselves the trouble
of reading the authors whom I have above
quoted, will find that they prescribe nothing
laxative. <span class="smcap">Actuarius</span> directs “things that
strengthen without heating<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>.” <span class="smcap">Aretæus</span>,
who, in consideration of the urgency
of the danger, recommends an immediate
recourse to remedies, prescribes none but
strengtheners, abstinence from the pleasures
of love, and the cold-bath<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Celsus</span>, of whose works both of them
have availed themselves, orders frictions, and
especially <i>baths extremely cold</i>, (<i>natationesque
quam frigidissimas</i>;) he would have nothing
eaten or drank but what is cold; that all aliments
should be avoided which may engender
crudities, wind, and augment the acridity
of the seed. <span class="smcap">Fernelius</span> orders nutritious
aliments, and restorative electuaries<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.</p>

<p>If the promise of <span class="smcap">Langius</span>, who said
“he would venture to swear for the efficacy
of purgatives and a diet in the cure of this
disorder,” be at all true, it cannot, probably,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
be relied on, but in that case alone,
where the disorder is produced by a bad diet,
which should have given birth to obstructions
in the <i>hypogastrium</i>, and made all the
humors degenerate, without the solids having
as yet received any considerable damage; and
this case it is that he must only have had in
view; for if the solids had received any material
prejudice, the purgatives must necessarily
be aided by corroboratives. Such was
the <i>gonorrhœa</i> that <span class="smcap">Regis</span> observed, and of
which <span class="smcap">Craanen</span> has preserved to us the
particulars.</p>

<p>“A man (says he) of a pituitous constitution,
having for along time used himself to
a humid diet, was attacked with the running
of a watery, crude, viscous humor,
which came away without perceptible sensation.
He was wasting away, his eyes grew
hollow, and he felt a daily decay of his
strength. <span class="smcap">Regis</span> began with him by evacuating
with purgatives those pituitous humor.”
After which he gave him corroboratives,
analeptics, and desiccative aliments;
and if that should not be sufficient, he advised
him a caustic for each leg<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>.</p>

<p>But this method of purgatives can never
be proper, when this disorder is the consequence
of venereal excesses, and is owing, as
<span class="smcap">Sennertus</span> observes, “to that weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
which the <i>vesiculæ seminales</i> have contracted
by the over-frequent vicissitudes
of repletion and inanition.”</p>

<p>A particularisation of some cases will afford
a clearer notion of the true method of
cure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Timæus</span> furnishes us with one, which
cannot be better placed than here.</p>

<p>“A young man, (says he,) a student of
the Law, of a sanguine constitution, used
to pollute himself manually twice or thrice
a day, and sometimes oftener: he fell into
a <i>gonorrhœa</i>, accompanied with a weakness
of the whole body. I looked on the
<i>gonorrhœa</i> as a consequence of a relaxation
occasioned in the seminal vessels, and on
his weakness as owing to his frequent effusions
of seed, which had dissipated the
natural heat, gathered crudities, damaged
the nervous system, stupified the soul, and
weakened the whole body.”</p>

<p>[He prescribed for him strengthening cordial
wine, with the astringents and aromatics
infused in a strong-bodied red wine, an
electuary of the same nature, and an ointment
composed of <i>oil of roses</i>, <i>mastic</i>, <i>nitre</i>,
<i>bol. armen. terra sigillata</i>, <i>balaustæ</i>, and
<i>white-wax</i>.]</p>

<p>“The patient was in about a month’s
time cured of this shameful disorder; and
I advised him to abstain in future from this
infamous practice of debauchery, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
remember the threat from the Most High,
of an exclusion of the effeminate from the
kingdom of Heaven,” 1 <span class="smcap">Cor.</span> vi.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Zimmerman</span> writes me as follows:
“One of the best Physicians that we have
in Switzerland, M. <span class="smcap">Wepfer</span>, whose authority
cannot be of too great weight,
avers his having cured a continual flux of
seed, the consequence of self-pollution,
with the help of the <i>Tinctur. Mart. Ludovici</i>.
M. <span class="smcap">Weslin</span> of Zurzach has, on
his own experience, confirmed to me the
same thing. As for me (adds my friend)
I cannot say that I have seen such good
effects from it.”</p>

<p>The Professor M. <span class="smcap">Stehelin</span> mentions a
man of letters, who was afflicted with an
involuntary efflux of seed, without any ideas
of venery, and who was cured by the use of
wine with the martials and the bark. The
remedies, and among others the waters of
Swalbach, the embrocating with cold water
the <i>pubis</i> and the <i>perinæum</i>, had not the
same success with a young man, who had
brought upon himself this disorder by self-pollution.
He adds, that M. <span class="smcap">de Bongars</span>,
a celebrated Practitioner of Physic at Maseck,
had cured two persons attacked with
a debility of the <i>vesiculæ seminales</i>, by making
them take, three times a day, eight or
ten drops of <span class="smcap">Sydenham</span>’s <i>liquid laudanum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
in a glass of Pontac wine, and by a decoction
of <i>sarsaparilla</i>. M. <span class="smcap">Stehelin</span> remarks,
that though the opium is contrary to the indications,
it has been advised by <span class="smcap">Etmullerus</span>
<i>against too quick an ejaculation, where
owing to an over-spirituousness in the seed</i>.
Be it here allowed me to add, that on attentively
examining the advice of this famous
practitioner, and on comparing the nature
of the disorder, in certain cases, with the effects
of opium, it is not difficult to conceive,
that this remedy may sometimes be useful,
but not in the case for which he prescribes
it. He distinguishes, with a great deal of
accuracy, the different kinds of runnings, he
assigns the causes and the curative method of
each kind, and then passing on to the ejaculation
which comes just on the beginning of
an erection, too quick (<i>nimis citam</i>,) he lays
down two causes for it; first, the relaxation
of the <i>vesiculæ seminales</i>; secondly, too boiling,
too spirituous, too redundant a seminal
liquid; and in this case it is that he orders
opium<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>. But on what foundation? Opium,
the quality of which, as a provocative to venery,
stands so well demonstrated, a quality
which <span class="smcap">Etmullerus</span> himself points out,
both in his small treatise on this medicine,
and in this very place where he gives this
advice, cannot but augment the cause of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
disorder, and consequently thereby aggravate
its symptoms. But the cases in which it
may be of service, are, on the contrary, where
the humors are crude, thin, aqueous, and
the nerves, at the same time, of an excessive
mobility. It is then known to be a remedy
for these different accidents, that it suspends
the irritability, and that it stops all the evacuations
except perspiration. It cannot then
be too often inculcated, that the greatest attention
must be had not to prescribe opium,
or opiates, but where they are proper, otherwise
they are capable of doing great mischief.
M. <span class="smcap">Tralles</span>, in his excellent work, furnishes
us with an observation, and the like
is to be met with in other authors, which
ought to oblige us to use a great deal of circumspection
as to that medicine.</p>

<p>“A man (says he) who from his youth
upwards had had a strong passion for self-pollutions,
which had rendered him extremely
weak, never took opium, either to
moderate a cough, or a diarrhœa, or with
any other intention, without having, in
the night, and to his great detriment, lascivious
dreams, accompanied with a spermatic
emission<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.”</p>

<p>Here may I have leave to state a reflexion
which presents itself naturally? It is this: the
error of <span class="smcap">Etmullerus</span> evidently proves:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p><i>First</i>, How great an influence an exact
theory has over practice, which, without its
help, cannot be but often false and erroneous.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, How great an advantage must a
man, furnished with such a theory, united
with practice, have over one, who has no
guide but a few observations, or who delivers
himself wholly up to a systematical
theory?</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, How much may not the reading
of even the best practical authors, but who
were destitute of that exact theory which is
due to our times, deceive such as, on the
reading of them, can only have an implicit
faith in them, and who are ignorant of those
principles which ought to serve for a touch-stone,
to discern, in physic, what is the good
ore, or the base alloy?</p>

<p>I shall conclude with two cases which fell
under my observation; a greater number
would be superfluous.</p>

<p>A young man of twenty years old, who
had had the misfortune of being addicted to
self-pollution, had been, for two months,
attacked with a continual mucous running,
and now and then with nocturnal pollutions,
attended with considerable wastings of his
strength; he had frequent and violent pains
of the stomach, he felt his breast extremely
weak, and was apt to sweat much: I ordered
him the following electuary:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>℞. <i>Condit. rosar. rubr. unc.</i> iii. <i>Condit.
anthos. Cort. Peruv. ana unc.</i> i. <i>Mastic.
dr.</i> ii. <i>Cath. dr.</i> i. <i>Olei cinnam. gutt.</i> iii.
<i>Sirup. Cort. aur. q.s.f. electuar. solid.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Of this he took a quarter of an ounce twice
a day. In three weeks time he found himself
recovered in all respects; and the running,
or gleet, no longer incommoded him,
unless after the nocturnal pollutions, which
were become less frequent; a continuation
of the same remedies for fifteen days more
completely restored him.</p>

<p>Two married persons, foreigners, whom
I never knew, were attacked almost at the
same time, with a running, accompanied
with weakness, and with pains along the
spine of the back. They were very sure there
was no venereal taint in the case, and could
impute their disorder to nothing but conjugal
excesses. The running was much the
most considerable in the husband. They had
tried various remedies, and all without any
effect, and among others some mercurial
pills, which had increased the running. At
length they had me consulted. I prescribed
for them the cold-bath, wine medicated with
the bark, steel, and flowers of red roses.
They took regularly my prescription: it was
the summer of 1758, when the rains rendered
the use of bathing in the river very
difficult: the wife bathed only once or twice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the husband a dozen of times. At five weeks
end, they sent me word that they were almost
totally restored: I advised them to continue
the method till the cure should be
completed, which it soon was.</p>

<p>These happy successes cannot, however,
serve for a general foundation of a favorable
prognostic: this disorder is often extremely
rebellious, and even sometimes incurable.
Of this I will give but one example, but it
is a demonstrative one.</p>

<p>One of the greatest Practitioners that we
have now in Europe, and who has enriched
the medical art with works, all of them excellent,
is actually himself afflicted with a <i>simple
gonorrhœa</i>, of fifteen years standing,
which not all his skill, nor that of some other
Physicians, whom he has consulted, have been
able to dissipate. This sad and vexatious disorder
wastes him away, little by little, and
gives room to fear the loss of him long before
the term to which it were to be wished
he should arrive, and to which he might attain
in the ordinary course of nature.</p>

<p>It would be needless for me to launch into
a farther extension: I have aimed at omitting
nothing that might open the eyes of youth
on the horrors of the precipice they are preparing
for themselves. I have done my best to
point out the most proper means of remedying
the evils they will have brought on themselves:
I conclude with a repetition of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
I have already said in the course of this work,
that some happy cures ought not to serve for
an encouragement of fallacious hopes; those
who are even the most happily cured, find
it a hard matter to recover their pristine vigor,
nor can preserve a transitory health but
by dint of a constant attention to regularity,
and to the keeping measures with their constitution;
the number of those who never
emerge out of a state of languor, is tenfold
to that of those who are cured; and some
examples of persons, who either had not been
more than slightly affected, or in whom
a more than ordinary vigorous constitution
might occasion the easier recovery, ought
not to be considered as constituting a general
rule,</p>
